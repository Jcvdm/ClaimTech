  - Stage 9: Admin (FRC in progress)
  - Stage 10: Terminal states (archived/cancelled)
- ✅ Updated all code examples with correct stage names
  - Stage transitions examples
  - Query pattern examples with "Phase 3 - Jan 2025" annotations
  - Inspections and Appointments show assessment-centric queries
  - FRC query changed from `.in()` to `.eq('frc_in_progress')`
- ✅ Updated "Adding New Stage" example
  - Scenario: Add quality_review between estimate_sent and estimate_finalized
  - Corrected TypeScript type definitions
  - Updated migration number to 075 (next available)
  - Complete workflow example with new stage
- ✅ Updated database constraints reference
  - Corrected appointment_id requirement stages (4-9 with names)
  - Added stage numbers for clarity

**Impact:**
- SOP now matches implemented Phase 3 architecture exactly
- Engineers have accurate examples for working with stages
- Clear guidance for adding new stages to pipeline

## Documentation Consistency

### Stage Names Consistency
All documentation now uses the correct 10 stage names:
1. ✅ `request_submitted`
2. ✅ `request_reviewed`
3. ✅ `inspection_scheduled`
4. ✅ `appointment_scheduled`
5. ✅ `assessment_in_progress`
6. ✅ `estimate_review`
7. ✅ `estimate_sent`
8. ✅ `estimate_finalized`
9. ✅ `frc_in_progress`
10. ✅ `archived` / `cancelled`

**Removed outdated stage names:**
- ❌ `request_accepted` → ✅ `request_reviewed`
- ❌ `assessment_completed` → ✅ `estimate_review` / `estimate_sent`
- ❌ `frc_completed` → ✅ `archived`

### Query Pattern Consistency
All documentation shows the same query patterns:
- Requests: `.in('stage', ['request_submitted', 'request_reviewed'])`
- Inspections: `.eq('stage', 'inspection_scheduled')`
- Appointments: `.in('stage', ['appointment_scheduled', 'assessment_in_progress'])`
- Open Assessments: `.in('stage', ['assessment_in_progress', 'estimate_review', 'estimate_sent'])`
- Finalized: `.eq('stage', 'estimate_finalized')`
- FRC: `.eq('stage', 'frc_in_progress')`
- Archive: `.in('stage', ['archived', 'cancelled'])`

- ✅ All documentation updated and committed
- ⏳ Push commits to remote repository

### Future Documentation Needs
- [ ] Frontend UI documentation for Inspections/Appointments pages (when UI work completed)
- [ ] Update project stats in README.md with migration count (74 migrations)
- [ ] Consider adding architecture diagram to project_architecture.md
- [ ] Add assessment lifecycle diagram to database_schema.md
