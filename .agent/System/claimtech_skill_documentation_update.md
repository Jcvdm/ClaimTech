## Workflows Implemented

### Workflow 1: Database Migration (15-30 min)
**Triggers:** "database", "migration", "schema", "table", "RLS"

**Steps:**
1. Review current schema in `.agent/System/database_schema.md`
2. Create idempotent migration with proper naming
3. Include indexes, RLS policies, triggers
4. Test migration locally
5. Update TypeScript types
6. Update database documentation

**Quality Checks:**
- Migration is idempotent (IF NOT EXISTS)
- RLS enabled and policies created
- Indexes on foreign keys
- updated_at trigger added
- Documentation updated

### Workflow 2: Service Layer Implementation (20-40 min)
**Triggers:** "service", "data access", "CRUD", "database query"

**Steps:**
1. Create service file in `src/lib/services/`
2. Use ServiceClient injection pattern
3. Implement CRUD operations
4. Add error handling
5. Export service instance

**Quality Checks:**
- ServiceClient injected (not created)
- Error handling on all DB calls
- TypeScript types for all returns
- Service exported as singleton

### Workflow 3: Authentication Flow (10-20 min)
**Triggers:** "auth", "login", "logout", "protect"

**Steps:**
1. Use form actions (NOT API routes)
2. Check auth in load functions
3. Implement RLS policies
4. Add role-based checks
5. Handle redirects properly

**Quality Checks:**
- Form actions used for mutations
- RLS policies protect data
- Role checks implemented
- Redirects to login when needed

### Workflow 4: Page Route Creation (15-30 min)
**Triggers:** "page", "route", "UI", "component"

**Steps:**
1. Create +page.svelte and +page.server.ts
2. Use ServiceClient in load function
3. Implement Svelte 5 runes ($state, $derived)
4. Add TypeScript types
5. Update navigation if needed

**Quality Checks:**
- ServiceClient used in server load
- Svelte 5 runes (not stores)
- TypeScript types complete
- Error boundaries added

### Workflow 5: PDF Generation (30-60 min)
**Triggers:** "PDF", "report", "document generation", "Puppeteer"

**Steps:**
1. Create HTML template in `src/lib/templates/`
2. Create API endpoint in `src/routes/api/generate-*/`
3. Use pdf-generator.ts utility
4. Upload to documents bucket
5. Return signed URL via proxy

**Quality Checks:**
- Template uses Tailwind for styling
- Puppeteer configured correctly
- File uploaded to storage
- Proxy endpoint returns signed URL

### Workflow 6: Storage & Photos (20-30 min)
**Triggers:** "upload", "photo", "storage", "file", "image"

**Steps:**
1. Use storage.service.ts
2. Upload to correct bucket (documents vs SVA Photos)
3. Create proxy endpoint for signed URLs
4. Never expose signed URLs directly
5. Handle file deletion

**Quality Checks:**
- Correct bucket used
- Proxy endpoint created
- No direct signed URL exposure
- Deletion handled

## Progressive Disclosure Pattern

The skill uses progressive disclosure to minimize token usage:

**Level 1: Metadata** (30-50 tokens)
- Loaded at startup
- Name and description only

**Level 2: SKILL.md** (loaded when relevant)
- Core workflows
- Quality checklists
- Quick reference

**Level 3: Resource Files** (loaded when needed)
- Detailed patterns
- Code examples
- Specific templates

This means:
- 10 skills installed = ~500 tokens (until used)
- Only relevant content loaded
- Scales efficiently
