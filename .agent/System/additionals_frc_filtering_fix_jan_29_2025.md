# Additionals FRC Filtering Fix - January 29, 2025

## Problem Summary

**Badge/Table Mismatch**: Additionals badge showed **7** but the table showed **0 records**, causing confusion and making it appear that additionals were missing.

## Root Cause

**Incorrect Filtering Logic**: The `listAdditionals()` method was filtering OUT all additionals where FRC had been started, but the badge count included all additionals regardless of FRC status.

### The Problematic Code

```typescript
// Lines 888-898 (REMOVED)
// Get assessment IDs that have FRC started
const { data: frcData } = await db.from('assessment_frc').select('assessment_id');

const assessmentsWithFRC = new Set((frcData || []).map((f) => f.assessment_id));

// Filter out additionals where FRC has been started
const filteredData = (data || []).filter(
  (record) => !assessmentsWithFRC.has(record.assessment_id)
);

return filteredData;  // ❌ Returns 0 records when all 7 have FRC
```

### Why This Was Wrong

1. **Badge Count**: Counted all assessments with additionals = **7**
2. **Table List**: Filtered out assessments with FRC = **0** (all 7 had FRC)
3. **Result**: Badge showed 7, table showed 0 ❌

## User Requirement

From the FRC Stage Transition Fixes documentation:

> "finalized assessment even with FRC open and additional should still show in finalized assessment until FRC is marked as COMPLETED"

This means:
- ✅ Additionals should be visible even when FRC is active
- ✅ FRC should be visible even when at `estimate_finalized` stage
- ✅ Both are **subprocesses** that don't hide the parent assessment

## Solution

**Removed the FRC filtering logic** from `listAdditionals()` method to match the subprocess pattern used by FRC.

### Fixed Code

```typescript
// Lines 878-892 (FIXED)
const { data, error } = await query;

if (error) {
  console.error('Error listing additionals:', error);
  return [];
}

// Return all additionals records - don't filter by FRC status
// Additionals should be visible even when FRC is active (subprocess pattern)
// This matches FRC page behavior and user requirement:
// "finalized assessment even with FRC open and additional should still show"
return data || [];  // ✅ Returns all 7 records
```

### Updated Method Documentation

```typescript
/**
 * List all additionals records
 * Joins with assessments, appointments, inspections, requests, and clients
 * Pulls vehicle data from assessment_vehicle_identification (updated during assessment)
 * Shows all additionals regardless of FRC status (subprocess pattern)
 */
```

## Files Modified

### 1. Additionals Service
**File**: `src/lib/services/additionals.service.ts`  
**Lines Changed**: 831-836 (documentation), 878-892 (logic)

**Changes**:
1. Updated method documentation to reflect subprocess pattern
2. Removed FRC filtering logic (lines 888-898)
3. Added clear comments explaining the subprocess pattern
4. Simplified return to `data || []`

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ Badge count: 7
- ❌ Table records: 0
- ❌ Mismatch caused confusion
- ❌ Additionals appeared to be missing

### After Fix
- ✅ Badge count: 7
- ✅ Table records: 7
- ✅ Counts match perfectly
- ✅ All additionals visible as expected

## Subprocess Pattern Established

### What is a Subprocess?

A **subprocess** is a child workflow (like FRC or Additionals) that:
1. Operates on a parent entity (assessment)
2. Has its own status/state independent of parent
3. **Does NOT hide the parent** from its current list/stage
4. Can exist alongside other subprocesses

### Subprocess Pages Should:

| Page | Query Base | Filter Logic | Shows |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Finalized Assessments** | `assessments` | `stage='estimate_finalized'` | All finalized (even with FRC/Additionals) ✅ |
| **FRC** | `assessment_frc` | None (shows all FRC records) | All FRC records ✅ |
| **Additionals** | `assessment_additionals` | None (shows all additionals) | All additionals ✅ |

### Key Principle

**Subprocesses are additive, not exclusive:**
- An assessment can have FRC AND Additionals simultaneously
- Starting FRC doesn't hide Additionals
- Starting Additionals doesn't hide FRC
- Both remain visible until assessment moves to `archived` stage

## Code Pattern

### ✅ CORRECT - Subprocess List Method

```typescript
async listSubprocess(client?: ServiceClient, engineer_id?: string | null): Promise<any[]> {
  const db = client ?? supabase;
  
  let query = db
    .from('subprocess_table')
    .select(`
      *,
      assessment:assessments!inner(...)
    `)
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
  
  // RLS policies automatically filter by engineer for non-admin users
  const { data, error } = await query;
  
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error listing subprocess:', error);
    return [];
  }
  
  // Return ALL subprocess records - no filtering by other subprocesses
  return data || [];
}
```

### ❌ WRONG - Filtering by Other Subprocesses

```typescript
// DON'T DO THIS - Subprocesses should not filter each other
const { data: otherSubprocess } = await db.from('other_subprocess').select('assessment_id');
const filtered = data.filter(record => !otherSubprocess.has(record.assessment_id));
return filtered;  // ❌ Creates badge/table mismatches
```

## Related Fixes

This fix is part of a series of subprocess-related fixes:

1. **FRC Stage Transition Fixes** (Jan 29, 2025)
   - Removed incorrect stage update when starting FRC
   - Assessments stay at `estimate_finalized` during FRC
   - Only move to `archived` when FRC completed

2. **Badge Count RLS & PostgREST Fixes** (Jan 29, 2025)
   - Fixed badge counts to use assessments-based queries
   - Engineers see only their assigned work

3. **Additionals FRC Filtering Fix** (Jan 29, 2025) ← This fix
   - Removed FRC filtering from Additionals list
   - Badge count now matches table count

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Code modified to remove FRC filtering
- [x] Method documentation updated
- [x] Comments added explaining subprocess pattern
- [ ] Manual test: Badge count matches table count (should both show 7)
- [ ] Manual test: All additionals visible regardless of FRC status
- [ ] Manual test: Works for both admin and engineer users
- [ ] Manual test: Can navigate to assessment from additionals list

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in future subprocess implementations:

1. **Document subprocess semantics** - Is this a subprocess or a stage transition?
2. **Don't filter by sibling subprocesses** - Subprocesses are independent
3. **Match badge and list logic** - Both should use same filtering rules
4. **Test badge/table counts** - Verify they match before deployment
5. **Follow subprocess pattern** - Query subprocess table, return all records

## Stage Filtering Update - January 29, 2025

### Additional Fix: Stage-Based Filtering

After fixing the FRC filtering issue, a follow-up requirement was identified:

> "When an assessment or report is finalized 'archived' - after FRC is done or assessment is cancelled, the additionals and FRC should not be listed - only active reports details should be listed here"

**Solution**: Added stage filtering to show only active assessments (`stage = 'estimate_finalized'`).

### Updated Implementation

**Additionals Service** (`src/lib/services/additionals.service.ts`):

1. **listAdditionals()** - Added stage filter:
```typescript
.eq('assessment.stage', 'estimate_finalized')  // Only active assessments
```

2. **getAssessmentsAtStageCount()** - Added stage filter to badge count:
```typescript
.eq('stage', 'estimate_finalized')  // Only active assessments
```

**FRC Service** (`src/lib/services/frc.service.ts`):

1. **listFRC()** - Added stage filter:
```typescript
.eq('assessment.stage', 'estimate_finalized')  // Only active assessments
```

2. **getCountByStatus()** - Added stage filter to badge count:
```typescript
.eq('stage', 'estimate_finalized')  // Only active assessments
```

### Stage-Based Visibility

| Assessment Stage | Additionals Page | FRC Page | Archive Page |
|-----------------|------------------|----------|--------------|
| `estimate_finalized` | ✅ Shows | ✅ Shows | ❌ Hidden |
| `archived` | ❌ Hidden | ❌ Hidden | ✅ Shows (Completed) |
| `cancelled` | ❌ Hidden | ❌ Hidden | ✅ Shows (Cancelled) |

### Benefits

1. **Clean Active Lists**: Only current work shown in Additionals/FRC pages
2. **Clear Separation**: Completed work moved to Archive page
3. **Consistent Pattern**: Same stage filtering for both subprocess pages
4. **Badge Alignment**: Badge counts match table counts with same filtering

## Key Learnings

1. **Subprocesses are independent** - Don't filter one subprocess by another
2. **Badge logic must match list logic** - Use same filtering rules for both
3. **Stage-based filtering** - Use assessment stage to control visibility across pages
4. **Active vs Terminal stages** - Only `estimate_finalized` is active for subprocess work
5. **User requirements drive design** - "only active reports" means stage filtering
6. **Test badge/table alignment** - Mismatches indicate filtering bugs
