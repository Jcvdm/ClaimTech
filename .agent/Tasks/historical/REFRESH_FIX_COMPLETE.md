# Random Refresh Fix - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: The assessment detail page was randomly refreshing every 30 seconds, causing users to lose unsaved input data while editing forms.

**Root Cause**: The auto-save function was calling `await invalidateAll()` every 30 seconds, which triggered a full route data refetch and component re-render, wiping out any unsaved form state.

**Solution**: Removed all `invalidateAll()` calls from the assessment detail page and created reusable utilities for draft autosave and unsaved changes guards.

## ✅ Changes Made

### Phase 1: Assessment Detail Page Refactor

**File**: `src/routes/(app)/work/assessments/[appointment_id]/+page.svelte`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Removed `invalidateAll()` from auto-save function (line 94)
- ✅ Removed `invalidateAll()` from 40+ handler functions
- ✅ Removed unused `invalidateAll` import
- ✅ Added comments explaining why invalidation is not needed
- ✅ Updated handlers to rely on service-level state updates

**Impact**:
- Auto-save now runs every 30s without triggering page reload
- User input is preserved during editing
- Background saves still persist data to database
- No more "random refresh" during editing

### Phase 2: Reusable Utilities Created

#### 1. Draft Autosave Utility

**File**: `src/lib/utils/useDraft.svelte.ts`

**Features**:
- ✅ localStorage-based draft persistence
- ✅ Throttled writes (default: 2s) to prevent excessive storage operations
- ✅ Automatic restore on mount
- ✅ Timestamp tracking
- ✅ Two APIs: functional (`useDraft`) and reactive (`useDraftState`)

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
// Functional API
const draft = useDraft('assessment-notes', { throttleMs: 2000 });
draft.save({ notes: 'My notes...' });
const currentDraft = draft.get();
draft.clear(); // After successful save

// Reactive API (Svelte 5 runes)
const notes = useDraftState('assessment-notes', '');
notes.value = 'New notes...'; // Auto-saves (throttled)
notes.clearDraft(); // After successful save
```

#### 2. Unsaved Changes Guard

**File**: `src/lib/utils/useUnsavedChanges.svelte.ts`

**Features**:
- ✅ `beforeunload` warning for page refresh/close
- ✅ SvelteKit navigation confirmation dialog
- ✅ Reactive tracker API
- ✅ Debounce and throttle utilities included

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
// Simple API
let hasUnsavedChanges = $state(false);
useUnsavedChanges(() => hasUnsavedChanges);

// Tracker API
const unsavedChanges = useUnsavedChangesTracker();
unsavedChanges.markUnsaved(); // On input
unsavedChanges.markSaved(); // After save
```

## 📋 How It Works Now

### Before (Problematic)
```
User types in form
  ↓
30 seconds pass
  ↓
Auto-save runs
  ↓
invalidateAll() called
  ↓
Route data refetched (__data.json)
  ↓
Component re-renders
  ↓
❌ Unsaved form input LOST
```

### After (Fixed)
```
User types in form
  ↓
30 seconds pass
  ↓
Auto-save runs
  ↓
updateTabCompletion() called (targeted update)
  ↓
✅ Form input PRESERVED
  ↓
Background save to database
  ↓
✅ Data persisted without page reload
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Auto-Save Without Refresh**
   - [ ] Navigate to assessment detail page
   - [ ] Start typing in any form field (notes, line items, etc.)
   - [ ] Wait 30+ seconds
   - [ ] Verify: Input is NOT lost
   - [ ] Verify: "Last saved" timestamp updates
   - [ ] Verify: No `__data.json` request in Network tab

2. **Test Form Input Persistence**
   - [ ] Fill in multiple form fields
   - [ ] Wait for auto-save (30s)
   - [ ] Verify: All fields retain their values
   - [ ] Verify: No flash/flicker during save

3. **Test Tab Completion**
   - [ ] Complete a tab (e.g., Vehicle Identification)
   - [ ] Verify: Tab marked as complete
   - [ ] Verify: Can navigate to next tab
   - [ ] Verify: No page reload

4. **Test Line Item Operations**
   - [ ] Add a line item to estimate
   - [ ] Edit a line item
   - [ ] Delete a line item
   - [ ] Verify: Changes persist without page reload
   - [ ] Verify: Totals update correctly

5. **Test Document Generation**
   - [ ] Generate a PDF document
   - [ ] Verify: PDF opens in new tab
   - [ ] Verify: No page reload on original tab
   - [ ] Verify: Form input preserved

### Network Monitoring

1. **Before Fix** (Expected):
   - `__data.json?x-sveltekit-invalidated=001` every ~30s
   - Multiple HEAD requests to Supabase
   - Page reload visible in Network tab

2. **After Fix** (Expected):
   - No `__data.json` requests during editing
   - Only targeted API calls (POST/PATCH to specific endpoints)
   - HEAD requests from sidebar polling (benign)

## 🚀 Next Steps (Future Phases)

### Phase 3: Apply Pattern to Other Edit Pages
- [ ] Requests Edit (`/requests/[id]/edit`)
- [ ] Inspections Detail (editable parts)
- [ ] Appointments (editable fields)
- [ ] Apply draft autosave utilities
- [ ] Apply unsaved changes guards

### Phase 4: Refine Post-Mutation Invalidations
- [ ] Review list pages (assessments, inspections, etc.)
- [ ] Keep manual refresh buttons (safe)
- [ ] Convert to targeted invalidation with `depends()`/`invalidate()`

### Phase 5: Optional Sidebar Optimization
- [ ] Pause sidebar polling on edit routes
- [ ] Resume polling on navigation away
- [ ] Reduce network noise during editing

## 📚 Best Practices Applied

### SvelteKit Best Practices
✅ **Avoid `invalidateAll()` during editing** - Use targeted updates instead
✅ **Progressive enhancement** - Use `enhance` for form submissions
✅ **Fine-grained invalidation** - Use `depends()` + `invalidate(key)` when needed
✅ **Preserve local state** - Don't trigger unnecessary re-renders

### Svelte 5 Runes Best Practices
✅ **`$state`** - For reactive local state
✅ **`$derived`** - For computed values
✅ **`$effect`** - For side effects (auto-save, event listeners)
✅ **Context API** - For sharing state across components (if needed)

### UX Best Practices
✅ **Draft autosave** - Persist user input to localStorage
✅ **Throttling** - Limit frequency of expensive operations
✅ **Unsaved changes warning** - Prevent accidental data loss
✅ **Background saves** - Persist to database without interrupting user

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### If Auto-Save Stops Working
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `updateTabCompletion()` is being called
3. Check Network tab for API calls
4. Verify `saving` state is toggling correctly

### If Form Input Still Lost
1. Check for other `invalidateAll()` calls in child components
2. Verify no `{#key}` blocks causing re-renders
3. Check for `bind:value` vs `value` + `oninput` issues
4. Look for parent component re-renders

### If Draft Autosave Not Working
1. Check localStorage in DevTools (Application tab)
2. Verify `useDraft` key is unique
3. Check throttle timing (default: 2s)
4. Verify browser supports localStorage

## 📝 Code Examples

### Before (Problematic)
```typescript
async function handleSave() {
  saving = true;
  try {
    await invalidateAll(); // ❌ Causes page reload
    await updateTabCompletion();
  } finally {
    saving = false;
  }
}
```

### After (Fixed)
```typescript
async function handleSave() {
  saving = true;
  try {
    // ✅ No invalidation, just targeted update
    await updateTabCompletion();
    lastSaved = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
  } finally {
    saving = false;
  }
}
```

## ✨ Summary

**Problem**: Random 30s refresh losing user input
**Solution**: Removed `invalidateAll()` from auto-save and handlers
**Result**: Smooth editing experience with preserved form state
**Bonus**: Reusable utilities for draft autosave and unsaved changes guards

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR TESTING**

Test the assessment detail page and verify that:
1. No more random refreshes during editing
2. Form input is preserved across auto-saves
3. Background saves still persist data
4. All functionality works as expected

---

**Next**: Apply this pattern to other edit pages and implement draft autosave for critical forms.
