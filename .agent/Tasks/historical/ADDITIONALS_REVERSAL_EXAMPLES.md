# Additionals Reversal - Practical Examples

## Real-World Scenarios with Step-by-Step Examples

---

## Example 1: Insurance Changes Mind on Declined Part

### Scenario
An assessor declines a bumper replacement because it seems repairable. The insurance company reviews the photos and insists the bumper must be replaced.

### Timeline

#### Step 1: Initial Assessment
```json
{
  "id": "line-001",
  "action": "added",
  "status": "declined",
  "description": "Front bumper - replacement",
  "total": 5000,
  "decline_reason": "Bumper is repairable, replacement not necessary"
}
```
**Estimate Total**: R 0 (declined items not counted)

#### Step 2: Insurance Insists on Replacement
Assessor clicks "Reinstate" button and enters reason:
```
"Insurance reviewed photos and requires replacement per policy"
```

System creates reversal entry:
```json
{
  "id": "line-002",
  "action": "reversal",
  "status": "approved",
  "reverses_line_id": "line-001",
  "reversal_reason": "Insurance reviewed photos and requires replacement per policy",
  "description": "Front bumper - replacement",
  "total": 5000
}
```

**Estimate Total**: R 5,000 (reversal is approved and counted)

#### Result
- Original declined entry preserved (audit trail)
- New reversal entry adds the part back
- **UI Display**: Original shows "Declined" badge, reversal shows "Reversal" badge
- Full history visible: declined ‚Üí reinstated with reason
- Insurance requirement documented

## Example 2: Assessor Adds Wrong Part, Then Corrects

### Scenario
Assessor accidentally approves a headlight for the wrong side, then needs to exclude it.

### Timeline

#### Step 1: Wrong Part Added and Approved
```json
{
  "id": "line-003",
  "action": "added",
  "status": "approved",
  "description": "Left headlight assembly",
  "total": 3500
}
```
**Estimate Total**: R 3,500

#### Step 2: Assessor Realizes Mistake
Assessor clicks "Reverse" button and enters reason:
```
"Wrong side - vehicle damage is on right side only"
```

System creates reversal entry:
```json
{
  "id": "line-004",
  "action": "reversal",
  "status": "approved",
  "reverses_line_id": "line-003",
  "reversal_reason": "Wrong side - vehicle damage is on right side only",
  "description": "Left headlight assembly",
  "total": -3500
}
```

**Estimate Total**: R 0 (3500 + (-3500) = 0)

**UI Display**:
- Original line-003 shows "Reversed" badge (NOT "Approved")
- Reversal line-004 shows "Reversal" badge with negative amount
- Both have blue background

#### Step 3: Add Correct Part
```json
{
  "id": "line-005",
  "action": "added",
  "status": "approved",
  "description": "Right headlight assembly",
  "total": 3500
}
```

**Estimate Total**: R 3,500 (correct part)

#### Result
- Wrong part entry preserved (audit trail)
- Reversal entry cancels it out
- Correct part added
- Full history shows: wrong part ‚Üí reversed ‚Üí correct part added

---

## Example 3: Original Line Removed, Then Needed Again

### Scenario
Assessor removes a door handle from original estimate thinking it's not damaged. Client later reports it's broken.

### Timeline

#### Step 1: Original Estimate Includes Door Handle
```json
// Original estimate line (from estimate tab)
{
  "id": "orig-001",
  "description": "Door handle - exterior",
  "total": 450
}
```
**Original Estimate Total**: R 450

#### Step 2: Assessor Removes It (Additionals Tab)
Assessor clicks "Remove" on original line.

System creates removal entry:
```json
{
  "id": "add-001",
  "action": "removed",
  "status": "approved",
  "original_line_id": "orig-001",
  "description": "Door handle - exterior",
  "total": -450
}
```

**Combined Total**: R 0 (450 + (-450) = 0)

#### Step 3: Client Reports It's Actually Broken
Assessor clicks "Reinstate Original" and enters reason:
```
"Client confirmed handle is broken, needs replacement"
```

System creates reversal entry:
```json
{
  "id": "add-002",
  "action": "reversal",
  "status": "approved",
  "reverses_line_id": "add-001",
  "reversal_reason": "Client confirmed handle is broken, needs replacement",
  "description": "Door handle - exterior",
  "total": 450
}
```

**Combined Total**: R 450 (450 - 450 + 450 = 450)

#### Result
- Original line preserved in estimate
- Removal entry preserved (audit trail)
- Reversal entry restores the line
- Full history: included ‚Üí removed ‚Üí reinstated with reason

## Example 4: Multiple Reversals on Same Item

### Scenario
A part goes through multiple status changes as assessment progresses.

### Timeline

#### Step 1: Part Added
```json
{
  "id": "line-006",
  "action": "added",
  "status": "pending",
  "description": "Windshield replacement",
  "total": 4500
}
```
**Total**: R 0 (pending)

#### Step 2: Part Approved
```json
{
  "id": "line-006",
  "status": "approved"
}
```
**Total**: R 4,500

#### Step 3: Insurance Declines (Assessor Reverses)
```json
{
  "id": "line-007",
  "action": "reversal",
  "status": "approved",
  "reverses_line_id": "line-006",
  "reversal_reason": "Insurance declined - windshield can be repaired",
  "total": -4500
}
```
**Total**: R 0 (4500 + (-4500))

#### Step 4: Repair Fails, Insurance Approves Replacement
Assessor clicks "Reinstate" on the reversal? No - they create a NEW additional:
```json
{
  "id": "line-008",
  "action": "added",
  "status": "approved",
  "description": "Windshield replacement - repair failed",
  "total": 4500
}
```
**Total**: R 4,500

#### Result
- Complete history preserved
- Each decision documented with reason
- Final total is correct
- Audit trail shows: approved ‚Üí reversed (declined) ‚Üí new approval

## Example 5: Bulk Scenario - Multiple Parts

### Scenario
Insurance initially approves estimate, then requests removal of several aftermarket parts, then later approves OEM parts.

### Initial State (All Approved)
```json
[
  { "id": "1", "description": "Aftermarket bumper", "total": 3000, "status": "approved" },
  { "id": "2", "description": "Aftermarket grille", "total": 800, "status": "approved" },
  { "id": "3", "description": "Aftermarket fog light", "total": 600, "status": "approved" }
]
```
**Total**: R 4,400

### Insurance Requests Removal
Assessor reverses each item:
```json
[
  { "id": "4", "action": "reversal", "reverses_line_id": "1", "total": -3000, "status": "approved" },
  { "id": "5", "action": "reversal", "reverses_line_id": "2", "total": -800, "status": "approved" },
  { "id": "6", "action": "reversal", "reverses_line_id": "3", "total": -600, "status": "approved" }
]
```
**Total**: R 0

### Insurance Approves OEM Parts
Assessor adds new items:
```json
[
  { "id": "7", "description": "OEM bumper", "total": 5000, "status": "approved" },
  { "id": "8", "description": "OEM grille", "total": 1200, "status": "approved" },
  { "id": "9", "description": "OEM fog light", "total": 900, "status": "approved" }
]
```
**Total**: R 7,100

### Final State
All entries preserved:
- Original aftermarket parts (approved)
- Reversals removing them (approved, negative)
- New OEM parts (approved)

**Calculation**: 3000 + 800 + 600 + (-3000) + (-800) + (-600) + 5000 + 1200 + 900 = R 7,100
