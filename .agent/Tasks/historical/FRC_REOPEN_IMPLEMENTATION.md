# FRC Reopen Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a "Reopen FRC" feature that allows users to revert a completed FRC back to "In Progress" status, enabling corrections and adjustments after sign-off.

---

## ✅ **Implementation Complete**

### **1. Server Endpoint** ✅
**File:** `src/routes/api/frc/[id]/reopen/+server.ts`

**Features:**
- POST endpoint at `/api/frc/[id]/reopen`
- Validates FRC exists and is in 'completed' status
- Updates FRC status to 'in_progress'
- Clears all sign-off fields (signed_off_by_name, signed_off_by_email, signed_off_by_role, signed_off_at, sign_off_notes, completed_at)
- Updates assessment status from 'archived' back to 'submitted'
- Logs audit trail for both FRC and assessment status changes
- Returns success/error response with proper HTTP status codes

**Security:**
- Server-side validation ensures only completed FRCs can be reopened
- Atomic updates to both tables
- Comprehensive error handling
- Audit logging for accountability

---

### **2. Service Method** ✅
**File:** `src/lib/services/frc.service.ts`

**Added Method:**
```typescript
async reopenFRC(frcId: string): Promise<void>
```

**Features:**
- Calls the server endpoint
- Handles response and errors
- Throws descriptive error messages
- Returns result for UI feedback

---

### **3. UI Component** ✅
**File:** `src/lib/components/assessment/FRCTab.svelte`

**Added Features:**
- "Reopen FRC" button appears when FRC status is 'completed'
- Button positioned next to sign-off details
- Confirmation modal with warning about consequences
- Loading state during reopen operation
- Error display if reopen fails
- Automatic reload of FRC data after successful reopen
- Triggers parent onUpdate to refresh lists/badges

**UI Flow:**
1. User sees "Reopen FRC" button on completed FRC
2. Clicks button → Confirmation modal appears
3. Modal explains what will happen:
   - Clear sign-off details
   - Reset FRC to "In Progress"
   - Move assessment from Archive to Finalized Assessments
   - Allow changes to line item decisions
4. User confirms → FRC reopened
5. UI refreshes to show updated status

---

### **4. Manual Reopen for Testing** ✅
**Assessment:** ASM-2025-002

**Actions Performed:**
- Reset FRC status from 'completed' to 'in_progress'
- Cleared all sign-off fields
- Updated assessment status from 'archived' to 'submitted'
- Added audit log entries for both changes

**Current Status:**
- FRC Status: `in_progress`
- Assessment Status: `submitted`
- Assessment now appears in **Finalized Assessments** list
- FRC now appears in **FRC List** with "In Progress" status
- Assessment removed from **Archive**

## 🎯 **Testing Workflow**

### **Test the Complete Cycle:**

1. **Navigate to Assessment ASM-2025-002:**
   - Go to `/work/finalized-assessments`
   - Click on ASM-2025-002
   - Go to FRC tab

2. **Verify Current State:**
   - ✅ FRC shows "In Progress" status
   - ✅ No sign-off details displayed
   - ✅ "Mark as Completed" button visible (if all lines decided)

3. **Complete FRC Again:**
   - Make any adjustments to line items if needed
   - Click "Mark as Completed"
   - Fill in sign-off modal
   - Click "Agree & Sign Off"

4. **Verify Completion:**

   - ✅ Sign-off details displayed
   - ✅ "Reopen FRC" button appears
   - ✅ Assessment moves to Archive (status: 'archived')
   - ✅ Assessment disappears from Finalized Assessments

5. **Test Reopen Feature:**
   - Click "Reopen FRC" button
   - Confirm in modal
   - Verify:
     - ✅ FRC status changes to "In Progress"
     - ✅ Sign-off details cleared
     - ✅ Assessment moves back to Finalized Assessments (status: 'submitted')
     - ✅ Assessment disappears from Archive

6. **Verify Audit Trail:**
   - Check activity timeline on assessment detail page
   - Should show all status changes with timestamps

## 🔒 **Security & Best Practices**

### **Server-Side Validation:**
- All mutations happen server-side via endpoint
- Validates FRC exists before attempting reopen
- Only allows reopening of 'completed' FRCs
- Prevents invalid state transitions

### **Audit Trail:**
- Every status change logged to audit_logs table
- Includes metadata about who/what triggered the change
- Preserves previous sign-off information in metadata
- Enables full accountability and history tracking

### **Atomic Operations:**
- Updates both FRC and assessment in single request
- Consistent state maintained across tables
- Error handling prevents partial updates

### **User Experience:**
- Clear confirmation modal with warnings
- Loading states during operations
- Error messages displayed to user
- Automatic UI refresh after changes
