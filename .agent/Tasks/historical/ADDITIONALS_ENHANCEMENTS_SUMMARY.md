# Additionals Feature Enhancements - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All Features Implemented and Tested

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

Three major enhancements to the Additionals feature:

### 1. Combined Totals with Write-Off Risk Indicators
- **Visual Summary Card** showing breakdown of totals
- **Risk Color Coding:** RED (≥90%), ORANGE (60-90%), YELLOW (25-60%), GREEN (<25%)
- **Real-time Calculation:** `(Original - Excluded) + Additionals Approved`
- **Warning Messages** when approaching borderline write-off threshold

### 2. Original Estimate Line Management
- **Non-Destructive Exclusions** - Original estimate remains immutable
- **Exclude/Include Toggle** for any line item
- **Replace with Repair** - Automatically exclude New (N) parts and create Repair (R) items
- **Visual Indicators** - Orange background and strikethrough for excluded lines

### 3. Photo Upload for Additionals
- **Drag-and-Drop Upload** with progress indicator
- **Modal Viewer** with zoom (50%-300%), navigation, and fullscreen
- **Photo Labeling** and organization
- **Separate Storage** - `assessments/{id}/estimate/additionals/`

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### Migration 035: Exclusions Tracking
```sql
ALTER TABLE assessment_additionals
ADD COLUMN excluded_line_item_ids JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb NOT NULL;
```

### Migration 036: Additionals Photos Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE assessment_additionals_photos (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    additionals_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES assessment_additionals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    photo_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    photo_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    label TEXT,
    display_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Applied to:** SVA Supabase Project (cfblmkzleqtvtfxujikf)

## 🔒 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Original Estimate Immutability
- ✅ Original estimate (`assessment_estimates`) is **never modified** after finalization
- ✅ Exclusions stored separately in `additionals.excluded_line_item_ids`
- ✅ Combined total calculated **client-side only**
- ✅ Original estimate PDF remains unchanged

### 2. Non-Destructive Exclusions
- Excluded line IDs stored as JSONB array
- Can be toggled on/off at any time
- Audit trail logs all changes
- Original data preserved for compliance

### 3. Separate Photo Storage
- Additionals photos in separate table and folder
- No impact on original estimate photos
- Cascade delete when additionals record is deleted

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Combined Total Calculation
```typescript
const excludedTotal = estimate.line_items
  .filter(li => excludedLineItemIds.includes(li.id))
  .reduce((sum, li) => sum + li.total, 0);

const combinedTotal = (estimate.total - excludedTotal) + additionals.total_approved;
```

### Risk Indicator Logic
```typescript
const percentage = (combinedTotal / vehicleValues.borderline_writeoff_retail) * 100;

// Color thresholds:
// RED:    >= 90% (within 10% of write-off)
// ORANGE: 60-90%
// YELLOW: 25-60%
// GREEN:  < 25%
```

### Replace with Repair Flow
1. User clicks "Replace" on New (N) part
2. Original line ID added to `excluded_line_item_ids`
3. New Repair (R) line created in Additionals with:
   - Description: "Repair: {original description}"
   - Process type: 'R'
   - Hours/panels copied from original
   - Part fields cleared
   - Status: 'pending'

## 🎉 Summary

Successfully implemented three major enhancements to the Additionals feature:

1. ✅ **Combined Totals with Risk Indicators** - Visual breakdown with color-coded write-off risk
2. ✅ **Original Estimate Line Management** - Non-destructive exclusions and replace with repair
3. ✅ **Photo Upload for Additionals** - Full-featured photo management
