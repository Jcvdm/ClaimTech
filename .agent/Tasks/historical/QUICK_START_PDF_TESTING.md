# Quick Start: PDF Generation Testing

## 🚀 Immediate Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test Puppeteer Installation (30 seconds)

```bash
# Make sure dev server is running
npm run dev

# Open in browser or use curl
http://localhost:5173/api/test-puppeteer
```

**✅ Success looks like:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Puppeteer is working correctly!",
  "details": {
    "pdfSize": 12345,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "status": "Chrome browser launched and PDF generated successfully"
  }
}
```

**❌ Failure looks like:**
```json
{
  "message": "Puppeteer test failed",
  "details": {
    "error": "Failed to launch Chrome browser",
    "hint": "Run: npm install puppeteer --force",
    "possibleCauses": [...]
  }
}
```

---

### Step 2: If Test Fails - Quick Fix

```bash
# Reinstall Puppeteer
npm uninstall puppeteer
npm install puppeteer --force

# Wait for Chrome to download (170-300MB)
# Then test again
```

---

### Step 3: Test Document Generation (2 minutes)

1. **Navigate to Assessment:**
   - Go to `/work/assessments`
   - Click on any assessment
   - Go to "Finalize" tab

2. **Generate Test Document:**
   - Click "Generate" on "Damage Inspection Report"
   - Watch for progress indicator: "Generating document... This may take 10-30 seconds"
   - Wait for completion

3. **Check Results:**
   - ✅ Green "Generated" badge appears
   - ✅ "Download" button becomes available
   - ✅ Click download to verify PDF opens correctly

---

### Step 4: Check Server Logs

Look for these messages in your terminal:

```
=== Testing Puppeteer Installation ===
Attempting to generate test PDF...
Browser launched successfully
HTML content loaded successfully
PDF generated successfully, size: 12345 bytes
Browser closed successfully
✅ Test PDF generated successfully!
```

---

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators
- Test endpoint returns `success: true`
- Progress indicator shows during generation
- Green "Generated" badge appears
- PDF downloads successfully
- Server logs show "Browser launched successfully"

### ❌ Failure Indicators
- Test endpoint returns error
- Error message in red box on UI
- Server logs show error with stack trace
- No PDF file created

---

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### Error: "Failed to launch Chrome browser"
```bash
npm install puppeteer --force
```

### Error: "PDF generation timed out"
- Your system is slow
- Close other applications
- Try again (retry logic will help)

### Error: "Failed to upload PDF to storage"
- Check Supabase Storage bucket exists
- Verify bucket is named "documents"
- Check bucket is public or has correct policies

### Error: "JSON.parse: unexpected character"
- Check server console for real error
- This is now handled gracefully
- Look for detailed error message in UI
