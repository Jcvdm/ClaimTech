# Engineer Registration & Role-Based Access Implementation

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Priority:** High
**Created:** October 25, 2025
**Completed:** October 25, 2025
**Requirements:** Admin-only engineer registration, password reset, role-based UI

---

## ✅ Implementation Summary

**All phases completed successfully:**

- ✅ **Phase 1**: Public signup removed, admin engineer creation implemented
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Password reset flow (forgot password + reset password pages)
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Role-based navigation and UI (layout server, sidebar filtering, dashboard counts)
- ✅ **Phase 4**: Service layer engineer filtering (assessment, appointment, FRC, additionals services)
- ✅ **Phase 5**: Route protection (admin-only routes redirect non-admins)

**Files Created:** 5 (forgot-password pages, reset-password pages, layout server)
**Files Modified:** 14 (hooks, login, callback, engineer creation, sidebar, dashboard, 5 work pages, 4 services)
**Files Deleted:** 2 (signup pages)

**Security Approach:** Three-layer security (route protection + data filtering + RLS policies)

---

## Problem Statement

Current authentication system allows public signup for engineers, which is not desired. Requirements:

1. **Admin-only engineer creation**: Only admins should be able to create engineer accounts
2. **Password reset flow**: Engineers should be able to reset forgotten passwords
3. **Role-based navigation**: Engineers should only see relevant menu items (no admin sections)
4. **Data filtering**: Engineers should only see appointments/assessments assigned to them
5. **Admin full access**: Admins should continue to see all data and have access to all features

---

## Current State Analysis

### Authentication System
- ✅ `user_profiles` table with role-based access (admin/engineer)
- ✅ RLS helper functions: `is_admin()`, `get_user_engineer_id()`
- ✅ Login flow working
- ❌ Public signup route exists at `/auth/signup`
- ❌ No password reset functionality
- ❌ No role-based UI filtering

### Navigation & UI
- ✅ Sidebar shows all menu items to all users
- ❌ No role-based filtering
- ❌ Engineers see admin-only sections (Clients, Engineers, Settings, etc.)

### Data Access
- ✅ RLS policies protect data at database level
- ✅ Engineers table has `auth_user_id` linking to auth.users
- ❌ UI/service layer doesn't filter by engineer_id
- ❌ Dashboard shows all work for all users

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Remove Public Signup & Admin Engineer Creation (30-45 min)

**1.1 Disable Public Signup**
- Delete `src/routes/auth/signup/+page.svelte`
- Delete `src/routes/auth/signup/+page.server.ts`
- Update `src/hooks.server.ts` - Remove `/auth/signup` from publicRoutes
- Update `src/routes/auth/login/+page.svelte` - Remove signup link

**1.2 Create Admin Engineer Registration**
- Update `src/routes/(app)/engineers/new/+page.server.ts`:
  - Use Supabase Admin API (service role) to create auth user
  - Generate temporary password
  - Create user_profiles entry with role='engineer'
  - Create engineers table entry
  - Trigger password reset email
- Update `src/routes/(app)/engineers/new/+page.svelte`:
  - Form: full_name, email, province, company
  - Success message: "Engineer created. Password reset email sent."

**1.3 Protect Engineer Management Routes**
- Add admin-only check to `/engineers/*` routes
- Redirect non-admins attempting to access

---

### Phase 2: Password Reset Functionality (30-45 min)

**2.1 Forgot Password Page**
- Create `src/routes/auth/forgot-password/+page.svelte`
  - Email input form
  - Success message after email sent
- Create `src/routes/auth/forgot-password/+page.server.ts`
  - Form action calling `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()`
  - Email redirect to `/auth/reset-password`

**2.2 Reset Password Page**
- Create `src/routes/auth/reset-password/+page.svelte`
  - New password input + confirm
  - Password strength requirements
- Create `src/routes/auth/reset-password/+page.server.ts`
  - Form action calling `supabase.auth.updateUser({ password })`
  - Redirect to dashboard on success

**2.3 Auth Callback Updates**
- Update `src/routes/auth/callback/+server.ts`
  - Handle type=recovery (password reset)
  - Redirect to `/auth/reset-password` for password reset

**2.4 Login Page Enhancement**
- Update `src/routes/auth/login/+page.svelte`
  - Add "Forgot password?" link below form

---

### Phase 3: Role-Based Navigation & UI (1-1.5 hours)

**3.1 Role Data Loading**
- Create `src/routes/(app)/+layout.server.ts`:
  - Load user profile with role from database
  - Get engineer_id if user is engineer
  - Return: `{ role, engineer_id, full_name, email }`
- Update `src/routes/(app)/+layout.svelte`:
  - Pass role data to Sidebar component

**3.2 Role-Based Sidebar**
- Update `src/lib/components/layout/Sidebar.svelte`:
  - Accept role prop from layout
  - Filter navigation items based on role:
    - **Admin**: All items (unchanged)
    - **Engineer**: Dashboard + Work sections only
    - **Engineer**: Hide Clients, Requests, Engineers, Repairers, Settings
  - Update badge count queries to filter by engineer_id for engineers

**3.3 Role-Based Dashboard**
- Update `src/routes/(app)/dashboard/+page.server.ts`:
  - Check user role
  - Filter counts by engineer_id if engineer
  - Admin sees all counts (unchanged)

**3.4 Role-Based Work Pages**
- Update all work pages to filter by engineer:
  - `src/routes/(app)/work/inspections/+page.server.ts`
  - `src/routes/(app)/work/appointments/+page.server.ts`
  - `src/routes/(app)/work/assessments/+page.server.ts`
  - `src/routes/(app)/work/finalized-assessments/+page.server.ts`
  - `src/routes/(app)/work/frc/+page.server.ts`
  - `src/routes/(app)/work/additionals/+page.server.ts`
  - `src/routes/(app)/work/archive/+page.server.ts`

### Phase 4: Service Layer Engineer Filtering (45-60 min)

**4.1 Inspection Service**
- Update `src/lib/services/inspection.service.ts`:
  - Add optional `engineer_id` parameter to queries
  - Filter: `appointments.engineer_id = engineer_id`

**4.2 Appointment Service**
- Update `src/lib/services/appointment.service.ts`:
  - Add optional `engineer_id` parameter
  - Filter: `engineer_id = engineer_id`

**4.3 Assessment Service**
- Update `src/lib/services/assessment.service.ts`:
  - Add optional `engineer_id` parameter
  - Join through appointments, filter by engineer_id

**4.4 FRC & Additionals Services**
- Update `src/lib/services/frc.service.ts`
- Update `src/lib/services/additionals.service.ts`
  - Join through assessment → appointment → engineer

---

### Phase 5: Route Protection (20 min)

**5.1 Admin-Only Route Checks**
- Update `src/routes/(app)/+layout.server.ts`:
  - Check role for admin-only routes
  - Redirect to dashboard if non-admin tries to access:
    - `/engineers/*`
    - `/clients/*`
    - `/requests/*`
    - `/repairers/*`
    - `/settings`

**5.2 Verify RLS Policies**
- Confirm user_profiles RLS prevents role changes
- Confirm engineers can't elevate privileges

## Technical Details

### Supabase Admin API Usage

```typescript
// In +page.server.ts with service role access
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import { SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY } from '$env/static/private';

const supabaseAdmin = createClient(
  PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY,
  { auth: { autoRefreshToken: false, persistSession: false } }
);

// Create user
const { data, error } = await supabaseAdmin.auth.admin.createUser({
  email: email,
  password: temporaryPassword,
  email_confirm: true,
  user_metadata: { full_name, role: 'engineer' }
});

// Trigger password reset
await supabaseAdmin.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(email, {
  redirectTo: `${url.origin}/auth/reset-password`
});
```

### Role-Based Filtering Pattern

```typescript
// In +page.server.ts
export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ locals }) => {
  const { supabase, user } = locals;

  // Get user role
  const { data: profile } = await supabase
    .from('user_profiles')
    .select('role, id')
    .eq('id', user.id)
    .single();

  // Get engineer_id if engineer
  let engineer_id = null;
  if (profile.role === 'engineer') {
    const { data: engineer } = await supabase
      .from('engineers')
      .select('id')
      .eq('auth_user_id', user.id)
      .single();
    engineer_id = engineer?.id;
  }

  // Filter data based on role
  const filters = profile.role === 'admin' ? {} : { engineer_id };
  const appointments = await appointmentService.getAppointments(filters, supabase);

  return { appointments, role: profile.role };
};
```

### Sidebar Navigation Filtering

```typescript
// Filter navigation based on role
const filteredNavigation = $derived(
  role === 'admin'
    ? navigation // All items
    : navigation.filter(group =>
        ['General', 'Work'].includes(group.label)
      )
);
```

### Key Implementation Patterns

**1. Parent Layout Data Access**
All work pages use `await parent()` to access role and engineer_id:
```typescript
export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ locals, parent }) => {
  const { role, engineer_id } = await parent();
  const isEngineer = role === 'engineer';
  // Filter data by engineer_id if engineer role
};
```

**2. Service Layer Filtering**
All services accept optional engineer_id parameter:
```typescript
async getInProgressAssessments(client?: ServiceClient, engineer_id?: string | null): Promise<any[]> {
  let query = db.from('assessments')...;
  if (engineer_id) {
    query = query.eq('appointments.engineer_id', engineer_id);
  }
  return await query;
}
```

**3. Route Protection**
Layout server checks admin-only paths and redirects:
```typescript
const adminOnlyPaths = ['/engineers', '/clients', '/requests', '/repairers', '/settings'];
const isAdminOnlyPath = adminOnlyPaths.some(path => url.pathname.startsWith(path));
if (isAdminOnlyPath && profile.role !== 'admin') {
  redirect(303, '/dashboard');
}
```
