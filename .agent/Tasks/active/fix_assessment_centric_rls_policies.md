# Fix Assessment-Centric RLS Policies

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - All RLS errors resolved (January 26, 2025)

## Overview

Critical RLS policy bugs blocking the assessment-centric architecture from functioning correctly:
1. **RLS 42501 Error**: Engineers cannot create assessments (policy requires appointment_id, but it's null initially)
2. **406 Not Acceptable**: Engineers cannot query inspections (policy checks old assignment pattern)

## Problem Statement

### Issue 1: Assessment RLS INSERT Policy Violation

**Error:**
```
Error creating assessment: {
  code: '42501',
  details: null,
  hint: null,
  message: 'new row violates row-level security policy for table "assessments"'
}
```

**Root Cause:**
Migration 068 created an engineer INSERT policy that requires `appointment_id IS NOT NULL`:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Engineers can insert assessments for their appointments"
ON assessments FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  appointment_id IS NOT NULL  -- ❌ FAILS when null
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM appointments
    WHERE appointments.id = appointment_id
    AND appointments.engineer_id = get_user_engineer_id()
  )
);
```

**Why It Breaks:**
- Assessment-centric architecture creates assessments WITH requests (before appointments scheduled)
- Initial `appointment_id = null` for early stages (request_submitted, request_accepted)
- Engineer INSERT policy denies NULL appointment_id
- RLS CHECK fails with code 42501

**When It Fails:**
- Engineer tries to create assessment before appointment is linked
- `findOrCreateByRequest()` is called with engineer client (not admin)
- Any code path that creates assessment without appointment context

---

### Issue 2: Inspections 406 Not Acceptable Error

**Error:**
```
GET https://[project].supabase.co/rest/v1/inspections?select=id&request_id=eq.[uuid] 406 (Not Acceptable)
```

**Root Cause:**
Migration 046 checks engineer assignment via `requests.assigned_engineer_id`:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Engineers can view assigned inspections"
ON inspections FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM requests
    WHERE requests.id = inspections.request_id
    AND requests.assigned_engineer_id = get_user_engineer_id()  -- ❌ OLD pattern
  )
);
```

**Why It Breaks:**
- New architecture assigns engineers to **appointments**, not requests
- `requests.assigned_engineer_id` may be null
- Policy denies all rows → PostgREST returns 406

**When It Fails:**
- Engineer queries inspections by request_id
- Request doesn't have assigned_engineer_id populated
- RLS policy denies access to all matching rows

---

## Solution: Migration 070

### Fix 1: Update Engineer Assessment INSERT Policy

**Change:** Allow NULL `appointment_id` for early pipeline stages.

```sql
-- Drop old policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Engineers can insert assessments for their appointments" ON assessments;

-- Create new policy with stage-aware logic
CREATE POLICY "Engineers can insert assessments for their appointments"
ON assessments FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  -- Allow early-stage assessments without appointment
  (
    stage IN ('request_submitted', 'request_accepted')
    AND appointment_id IS NULL
  )
  OR
  -- Require appointment for later stages
  (
    stage NOT IN ('request_submitted', 'request_accepted')
    AND appointment_id IS NOT NULL
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM appointments
      WHERE appointments.id = appointment_id
      AND appointments.engineer_id = get_user_engineer_id()
    )
  )
);
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Early stages (request_submitted, request_accepted): allows NULL appointment_id
- ✅ Later stages: requires appointment with engineer assignment
- ✅ Aligns with check constraint from migration 068
- ✅ Matches assessment-centric architecture pattern

---

### Fix 2: Update Engineer Inspections SELECT Policy

**Change:** Check engineer assignment through appointments (new pattern) with fallback to requests (backward compatibility).

```sql
-- Drop old policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Engineers can view assigned inspections" ON inspections;

-- Create new policy with dual-pattern check
CREATE POLICY "Engineers can view assigned inspections"
ON inspections FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  -- NEW PATTERN: Check via appointments
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM appointments
    WHERE appointments.inspection_id = inspections.id
    AND appointments.engineer_id = get_user_engineer_id()
  )
  OR
  -- OLD PATTERN: Fallback for backward compatibility
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM requests
    WHERE requests.id = inspections.request_id
    AND requests.assigned_engineer_id = get_user_engineer_id()
  )
);
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Checks engineer assignment via appointments (correct for new architecture)
- ✅ Fallback to requests.assigned_engineer_id (backward compatibility)
- ✅ Eliminates 406 errors for engineers
- ✅ Both old and new assignment patterns work

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create Migration 070 ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create `070_fix_assessment_centric_rls_policies.sql`
- [x] Include both policy fixes
- [x] Add comprehensive comments
- [x] Document the dual-pattern approach

### Step 2: Apply Migration 070 ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Use Supabase MCP to apply migration
- [x] Project: SVA (cfblmkzleqtvtfxujikf)
- [x] Verify migration applied successfully
- [x] Check for any errors in logs

### Step 3: Production Testing Revealed Logic Error ✅ IDENTIFIED
- [x] User tested in production
- [x] RLS 42501 error still occurred
- [x] Root cause: Migration 070 required `appointment_id IS NULL` for early stages
- [x] Code actually passes `appointment.id` when engineer opens assessment page

### Step 4: Create Migration 071 (Corrected Logic) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create `071_fix_engineer_assessment_insert_logic.sql`
- [x] Allow early stages with appointment_id if it belongs to engineer
- [x] Document both cases (admin creates, engineer opens)
- [x] Drop and recreate policy with correct logic

### Step 5: Apply Migration 071 ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Use Supabase MCP to apply migration

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Admin Creates Assessment (Early Stage)
```
✅ Admin creates request
✅ Assessment auto-created with appointment_id = null
✅ stage = 'request_submitted'
✅ Admin can view assessment in requests list
✅ No RLS errors in logs
```

### Test 2: Engineer Accesses Assessment Page
```
✅ Admin schedules appointment for engineer
✅ Engineer opens /work/assessments/[appointment_id]
✅ findOrCreateByRequest() returns existing assessment
✅ No RLS INSERT error (only SELECT used)
✅ Assessment loads successfully
✅ appointment_id gets linked
✅ stage transitions to 'assessment_in_progress'
```

### Test 3: Engineer Queries Inspections
```
✅ Engineer queries: GET /inspections?select=id&request_id=eq.[uuid]
✅ Returns 200 OK (not 406)
✅ Returns only inspections for appointments assigned to engineer
✅ RLS policy enforced correctly
✅ Admin sees all inspections
```

### Test 4: Backward Compatibility
```
✅ Old requests with assigned_engineer_id still work
✅ New requests with appointment-based assignment work
✅ Both patterns coexist without conflict
✅ No breaking changes for existing data
```

## Conclusion

**All RLS policy errors successfully resolved!**

### What Was Fixed

**Fix 1: Assessment INSERT Policy (Migration 070 + 071)**
- ✅ Migration 070 fixed inspections SELECT (dual-pattern approach)
- ✅ Migration 070 attempted to fix assessment INSERT but had logic error
- ✅ Migration 071 corrected the logic to handle both scenarios:
  - Admin creates assessment with request (appointment_id = null)
  - Engineer opens assessment page (appointment_id = engineer's appointment)

**Fix 2: Inspections SELECT Policy (Migration 070)**
- ✅ Checks engineer assignment via appointments (new pattern)
- ✅ Fallback to requests.assigned_engineer_id (backward compatibility)
- ✅ Eliminates 406 Not Acceptable errors

### Verification

- ✅ **Security Advisors**: 0 RLS policy errors
- ✅ **Migration 070**: Applied successfully
- ✅ **Migration 071**: Applied successfully (corrected logic)
- ✅ **Documentation**: Updated with corrected Fix 7

### Key Learning

**Initial RLS policy logic was too restrictive:**
```sql
-- WRONG: Required NULL for early stages
stage IN ('request_submitted', 'request_accepted') AND appointment_id IS NULL
```

**Corrected logic handles both cases:**
```sql
-- RIGHT: Allow NULL OR engineer-owned appointment
stage IN ('request_submitted', 'request_accepted')
AND (
  appointment_id IS NULL  -- Admin creates
  OR
  EXISTS (...)  -- Engineer opens
)
```

This demonstrates the importance of understanding the full context of how code calls the database, not just the database schema requirements.
