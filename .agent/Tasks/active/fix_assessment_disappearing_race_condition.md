# Fix Assessment Disappearing Race Condition

**Status:** 🔴 IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Created:** January 25, 2025
**Estimated Time:** 90 minutes

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

Fix the recurring race condition that causes:
1. Assessment creation failures despite retry logic
2. Appointments disappearing after "Start Assessment" click
3. 500 errors when assessments fail to create
4. Missing assessments for users (reported: 3 missing for vandermerwe.jaco194@gmail.com)

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Primary Issue: Premature Appointment Status Update**

The critical flaw is in the frontend workflow:

```typescript
// Current BROKEN flow (appointments/+page.svelte:161-173):
async function handleStartAssessment(appointmentId: string) {
    // ❌ PROBLEM: Status updated BEFORE assessment creation confirmed
    await appointmentService.updateAppointmentStatus(appointmentId, 'in_progress');

    // Navigate to assessment page (will attempt to auto-create)
    goto(`/work/assessments/${appointmentId}`);
}
```

**What happens:**
1. User clicks "Start Assessment"
2. Frontend updates appointment status to `in_progress` ✅
3. Frontend navigates to `/work/assessments/[appointment_id]`
4. Server tries to create assessment → **FAILS** with duplicate key error ❌
5. Appointment now has status `in_progress` but **NO ASSESSMENT EXISTS** ❌
6. User refreshes page
7. Appointment filtered out (only shows `status: 'scheduled'`) ❌
8. **Appointment appears to have "disappeared"** ❌

### **Secondary Issue: Double-Click Race Condition**

**Problem:** No debounce or loading state prevents multiple clicks

**Scenario:**
- User double-clicks "Start Assessment" button (< 100ms apart)
- Two parallel requests sent to server
- Both requests:
  1. Count assessments → Get same count (e.g., 5)
  2. Generate same number (e.g., ASM-2025-006)
  3. Try to insert
  4. First succeeds, second fails with duplicate key
- Even with retry logic, if both requests count simultaneously, retries can still fail

### **Tertiary Issue: Insufficient Error Recovery**

**Problem:** Current error recovery wait time is too short (500ms)

```typescript
// Current code (assessment/[appointment_id]/+page.server.ts:259):
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // Only 500ms!
```

**Why it fails:**
- If first request takes > 500ms to commit transaction
- Second request fetches before first request completes
- Fetch returns null → 500 error thrown

---

## 📊 **User Impact**

### **Reported Issue:**
- User: `vandermerwe.jaco194@gmail.com`
- Expected: 3 open assessments
- Actual: 0 assessments showing
- Appointments: Missing (filtered out because status = `in_progress`)

### **Symptoms:**
- ❌ Appointments disappear after clicking "Start Assessment"
- ❌ 500 error shown to user
- ❌ Console shows "Failed to fetch assessment after duplicate key error"
- ❌ Assessments appear "lost" (actually don't exist, but appointments are marked in_progress)

---

## 🔧 **Implementation Plan**

### **Fix 1: Remove Premature Status Update (CRITICAL)**

**Priority:** 🔴 HIGHEST
**Time:** 30 minutes
**Impact:** Prevents appointments from disappearing

**Changes:**

1. **Remove status update from frontend** (`appointments/+page.svelte`)
   - Remove `updateAppointmentStatus()` call from `handleStartAssessment()`
   - Keep simple navigation to assessment page

2. **Add status update to backend** (`assessments/[appointment_id]/+page.server.ts`)
   - Update appointment status AFTER successful assessment creation
   - Only update if assessment was newly created (not fetched)

**Files to modify:**
- `src/routes/(app)/work/appointments/+page.svelte` (lines 161-173)
- `src/routes/(app)/work/assessments/[appointment_id]/+page.server.ts` (after line 57)
- `src/lib/services/appointment.service.ts` (verify method exists)

---

### **Fix 2: Add Frontend Double-Click Prevention**

**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH
**Time:** 15 minutes
**Impact:** Reduces race condition probability by 90%

**Changes:**

1. Add loading state per appointment
2. Disable button during navigation
3. Add debounce to prevent rapid clicks

**File to modify:**
- `src/routes/(app)/work/appointments/+page.svelte` (lines 161-173)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
let startingAssessment = $state<string | null>(null);

async function handleStartAssessment(appointmentId: string) {
    if (startingAssessment === appointmentId) return; // Prevent double-click

    startingAssessment = appointmentId;
    try {
        goto(`/work/assessments/${appointmentId}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error starting assessment:', error);
        alert('Failed to start assessment. Please try again.');
    } finally {
        // Reset after navigation delay
        setTimeout(() => startingAssessment = null, 1000);
    }
}
```

---

### **Fix 3: Improve Server-Side Error Recovery**

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM
**Time:** 15 minutes
**Impact:** Better recovery when race conditions do occur

**Changes:**

1. Increase wait time from 500ms to 1000ms
2. Add polling retry logic (3 attempts)
3. Better error messages

**File to modify:**
- `src/routes/(app)/work/assessments/[appointment_id]/+page.server.ts` (lines 40-85)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
} catch (createError: any) {
    if (createError.message && createError.message.includes('duplicate key')) {
        console.log('Race condition detected: assessment already exists, fetching existing assessment...');

        // Wait longer for other request to complete (increased from 500ms)
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

        assessment = await assessmentService.getAssessmentByAppointment(appointmentId, locals.supabase);

        if (!assessment) {
            // Retry fetch with polling (3 attempts)
            console.log('Assessment not found, retrying fetch...');
            for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
                assessment = await assessmentService.getAssessmentByAppointment(appointmentId, locals.supabase);
                if (assessment) {
                    console.log(`Assessment found on retry ${i + 1}`);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        if (!assessment) {
            console.error('Failed to fetch assessment after duplicate key error');
            throw error(500, 'Failed to create or fetch assessment. Please try again.');
        }

        console.log('Successfully recovered from race condition, using existing assessment');
    } else {
        throw error(500, `Failed to create assessment: ${createError.message}`);
    }
}
```

### **Fix 4: Data Recovery - Find Missing Assessments**

**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH
**Time:** 20 minutes
**Impact:** Restore user's missing assessments

**Investigation Steps:**

1. Query appointments with `status = 'in_progress'` but no assessment
2. Query assessments without matching appointment
3. Identify orphaned records
4. Create manual fix script if needed

**SQL Queries:**
```sql
-- Find appointments marked in_progress without assessments
SELECT a.id, a.appointment_number, a.status, a.engineer_id
FROM appointments a
LEFT JOIN assessments ass ON ass.appointment_id = a.id
WHERE a.status = 'in_progress' AND ass.id IS NULL;

-- Find assessments without valid appointments
SELECT ass.id, ass.assessment_number, ass.appointment_id
FROM assessments ass
LEFT JOIN appointments a ON a.id = ass.appointment_id
WHERE a.id IS NULL;

-- Check for user's specific data
SELECT
    u.email,
    COUNT(DISTINCT a.id) as appointments_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ass.id) as assessments_count
FROM user_profiles up
JOIN users u ON u.id = up.user_id
LEFT JOIN appointments a ON a.engineer_id = up.user_id AND a.status = 'in_progress'
LEFT JOIN assessments ass ON ass.appointment_id = a.id
WHERE u.email = 'vandermerwe.jaco194@gmail.com'
GROUP BY u.email;
```

## 🎓 **Technical Details**

### **Why Previous Fix Was Incomplete**

The previous fix ([fix_assessment_race_condition.md](./fix_assessment_race_condition.md)) addressed:
- ✅ Retry logic in service layer
- ✅ Exponential backoff
- ✅ Server-side error handling

But **MISSED**:
- ❌ Frontend double-click prevention
- ❌ Appointment status update timing
- ❌ Sufficient error recovery wait times
- ❌ Root cause: status updated before creation confirmed

### **Correct Workflow**

**Before (BROKEN):**
```
User clicks → Update status → Navigate → Create assessment (may fail) → Appointment disappears
```

**After (FIXED):**
```
User clicks → Navigate → Create assessment → Update status (on success) → Appointment visible if fails
```

### **Defense in Depth**

This fix implements **three layers of protection**:

1. **Layer 1: Frontend Prevention**
   - Double-click prevention
   - Loading states
   - Debounce

2. **Layer 2: Correct Timing**
   - Status update AFTER creation
   - Transactional consistency
   - Rollback safety

3. **Layer 3: Server Recovery**
   - Extended wait times
   - Polling retries
   - Better error messages

---

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ Double-click causes duplicate key errors
- ❌ Appointments disappear when assessment creation fails
- ❌ 500 errors shown to users
- ❌ Assessments appear "lost"
- ❌ Retry logic fails due to simultaneous counting

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Double-click prevented (button disabled)
- ✅ Appointments remain visible if creation fails
- ✅ Graceful error recovery with polling
- ✅ Better user experience (no confusing errors)
- ✅ Status updated only after confirmation

## 🚀 **Long-Term Solution**

For production, consider implementing **database sequences** for truly atomic number generation:

```sql
-- Migration: 068_assessment_number_sequence.sql
CREATE SEQUENCE assessment_number_seq START 1;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_assessment_number()
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
DECLARE
  year TEXT := EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE)::TEXT;
  seq_num INTEGER := nextval('assessment_number_seq');
BEGIN
  RETURN 'ASM-' || year || '-' || LPAD(seq_num::TEXT, 3, '0');
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

ALTER TABLE assessments
ALTER COLUMN assessment_number
SET DEFAULT generate_assessment_number();
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Eliminates race conditions entirely
- ✅ Database-level atomic guarantee
- ✅ Industry standard approach
- ✅ No retry logic needed

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ Numbers may have gaps (acceptable)
- ⚠️ Requires migration
- ⚠️ Sequence resets require manual intervention

---

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

Fix is successful when:
- ✅ User can double-click "Start Assessment" without errors
- ✅ Appointments remain visible if assessment creation fails
- ✅ Assessment is created successfully on first try
- ✅ No duplicate key errors in console
- ✅ No 500 errors shown to user
- ✅ User vandermerwe.jaco194@gmail.com can see all 3 assessments
- ✅ Smooth navigation to assessment page
- ✅ Status updates only after successful creation
