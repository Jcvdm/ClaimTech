# Implementation Complete: ASM-2025-016 Fix

**Date:** January 27, 2025
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE - Ready for Testing
**Related PRD:** [fix_inspection_detail_and_engineer_visibility.md](fix_inspection_detail_and_engineer_visibility.md)

## Summary

Successfully fixed the ASM-2025-016 inspection visibility, appointment scheduling, and navigation issues by converting the inspection detail page from table-centric to assessment-centric architecture. All critical security vulnerabilities identified during code review have been addressed. Additional navigation fix applied to resolve 500 error when clicking inspections from the list page.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Assessment-Centric Detail Page âœ…
**Files Modified:**
- `src/routes/(app)/work/inspections/[id]/+page.server.ts`
- `src/routes/(app)/work/inspections/[id]/+page.svelte`

**Changes:**
- Server load now queries `assessments` table first (was: `inspections`)
- Loads inspection via `assessment.inspection_id` foreign key
- Handles null inspection gracefully for backward compatibility
- Added `$derived` helper variable for data merging in Svelte component
- Replaced all `data.inspection.X` references with reactive `inspection.X`

**Impact:** Admin can now view ASM-2025-016 without 500 error

### 2. Secure RLS Policy Migration âœ…
**Files Created:**
- `supabase/migrations/20251027180316_add_inspection_based_assessment_access.sql`
- Additional fix migration applied via MCP

**Changes:**
- Added Path 4: Inspection-based access for engineers at stage 3
- **SECURITY FIX**: Only allows access when `appointment_id IS NULL` OR appointment matches same engineer
- Prevents cross-engineer access conflicts
- Created performance indexes:
  - `idx_inspections_assigned_engineer`
  - `idx_appointments_engineer`
  - `idx_appointments_id_engineer` (composite)
  - `idx_assessments_inspection`
  - `idx_assessments_appointment`

**Impact:** Engineer Jakes can now see ASM-2025-016 via secure inspection-based access

### 3. Fixed Engineer Filtering âœ…
**File Modified:**
- `src/routes/(app)/work/inspections/+page.server.ts`

**Changes:**
- Changed from `query.eq('request.assigned_engineer_id', ...)` to proper INNER JOIN
- Engineers: Uses `inspections!inner(*)` with filter on `inspection.assigned_engineer_id`
- Admins: Uses `inspections(*)` LEFT JOIN to see all assessments

**Impact:** Engineers will see correct filtered list of assigned inspections

### 4. Appointment Creation Validation âœ…
**File Modified:**
- `src/routes/(app)/work/inspections/[id]/+page.svelte` (lines 241-318)

**Changes Added:**
- Validates `data.inspection` exists before creating appointment
- Validates `assessment.inspection_id` is populated
- Uses `assessment.inspection_id` directly (not fallback chain)
- Verifies appointment's `inspection_id` matches before linking
- Clear error messages for each validation failure

**Impact:** Prevents data integrity errors in appointment creation

### 6. Navigation Fix for 500 Error âœ…
**File Modified:**
- `src/routes/(app)/work/inspections/+page.svelte` (lines 102-114)

**Changes:**
- Fixed `handleOpenReport()` to check appointment_id existence before routing
- Routes to `/work/inspections/{id}` when appointment_id is NULL
- Routes to `/work/assessments/{appointment_id}` when appointment exists
- Added explanatory comments for routing logic

**Impact:** Admin and engineers can now click inspections without 500 error

### 5. Stage Update Order Fix âœ…
**File Modified:**
- `src/routes/(app)/work/inspections/[id]/+page.svelte` (lines 98-146)

**Changes:**
- Clears foreign keys (`appointment_id`, `inspection_id` â†’ NULL) BEFORE stage transition
- Follows check constraint order (stage 1 requires FKs to be NULL)
- Prevents constraint violation errors during cancellation

**Impact:** Cancel inspection workflow works without database errors

## Database Changes Applied

### Migrations Applied via MCP:
1. **Initial RLS Policy** (20251027180316)
   - Dropped existing engineer access policies
   - Created new SELECT policy with 4 paths
   - Created new UPDATE policy with 4 paths
   - Added performance indexes

2. **Security Fix** (fix_rls_security_inspection_access)
   - Fixed Path 4 to prevent cross-engineer access
   - Added composite index on `appointments(id, engineer_id)`
   - Ensured inspection access only when appointment NULL or matches

### Database State After Migration:

**ASM-2025-016:**
- `stage`: inspection_scheduled
- `inspection_id`: 564278a8-971f-4a8c-adf9-c26def287dcb (INS-2025-013)
- `appointment_id`: NULL
- Inspection assigned to engineer: ad521f89-720e-4082-8600-f523fbd26ed5 (Jakes)

**Expected Behavior:**
- âœ… Engineer Jakes can see ASM-2025-016 (via RLS Path 4)
- âœ… Admin can view detail page without error
- âœ… Appointment can be created from detail page
- âœ… No cross-engineer data leaks
