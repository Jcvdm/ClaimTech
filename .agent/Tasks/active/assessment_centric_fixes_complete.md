# Assessment-Centric Architecture - All Fixes Complete

## Status
✅ **ALL BLOCKING ISSUES FIXED** - Production ready (January 26, 2025)

## Overview

Code review identified 6 critical blocking issues in the initial implementation. All issues have been fixed and verified. The system is now truly production-ready with:

- ✅ Correct database constraint handling
- ✅ Proper RLS authentication flow
- ✅ Truly idempotent operations
- ✅ No duplicate record creation
- ✅ Correct retry logic scoping

---

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Start Assessment Flow Order ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Updated stage BEFORE linking appointment_id
- Violated check constraint requiring appointment_id for stage='assessment_in_progress'
- Would cause constraint error and/or RLS failure

**Solution:**
```typescript
// OLD (WRONG ORDER)
assessment = await updateStage(id, 'assessment_in_progress', ...);
assessment = await updateAssessment(id, { appointment_id }, ...);

// NEW (CORRECT ORDER)
// 1) Link appointment FIRST
assessment = await updateAssessment(id, { appointment_id }, locals.supabase);

// 2) THEN update stage
assessment = await updateStage(id, 'assessment_in_progress', locals.supabase);
```

**File Changed:**
- `src/routes/(app)/work/assessments/[appointment_id]/+page.server.ts`

**Impact:** Eliminates constraint violations and ensures proper RLS context

---

### Fix 2: updateAssessment Missing Client Parameter ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Used global `supabase` instance instead of accepting authenticated client
- Broke RLS on server (unauthenticated anon context)
- Especially problematic for admin-only updates

**Solution:**
```typescript
// OLD
async updateAssessment(id: string, input: UpdateAssessmentInput): Promise<Assessment> {
  const { data } = await supabase.from('assessments').update(input)...

// NEW
async updateAssessment(id: string, input: UpdateAssessmentInput, client?: ServiceClient): Promise<Assessment> {
  const db = client ?? supabase;
  const { data } = await db.from('assessments').update(input)...
```

**File Changed:**
- `src/lib/services/assessment.service.ts`

**Impact:** Proper RLS enforcement with authenticated context

---

### Fix 3: findOrCreateByRequest Logic Bug ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Incorrect handling of `.maybeSingle()` return value
- `.maybeSingle()` returns `data=null` and `error=null` when no row found
- Code threw "Unexpected state" error instead of creating assessment
- Broke backward compatibility for old requests without assessments

**Solution:**
```typescript
// OLD (WRONG)
const { data: existing, error: findError } = await db.from('assessments')...maybeSingle();
if (existing) return existing;
if (findError && findError.code === 'PGRST116') {
  return this.createAssessmentForRequest(requestId, client);
}
throw new Error('Unexpected state'); // ❌ Would throw when data=null, error=null

// NEW (CORRECT)
const { data: existing, error: findError } = await db.from('assessments')...maybeSingle();
if (findError) throw new Error(`Failed to find assessment: ${findError.message}`);
if (existing) return existing;
return this.createAssessmentForRequest(requestId, client); // ✅ Creates when not found
```

**File Changed:**
- `src/lib/services/assessment.service.ts`

**Impact:** Truly idempotent operation, handles old requests correctly

---

### Fix 4: Add Unique Constraints for Idempotent Child Records ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Re-entering "Start Assessment" (refreshes, retries) created duplicate child records
- No unique constraints on:
  - `assessment_tyres` (assessment_id, position)
  - `assessment_vehicle_values` (assessment_id)
  - `pre_incident_estimates` (assessment_id)

**Solution:**
Created migration `069_add_child_record_unique_constraints.sql`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE assessment_tyres
  ADD CONSTRAINT uq_assessment_tyres_position UNIQUE (assessment_id, position);

ALTER TABLE assessment_vehicle_values
  ADD CONSTRAINT uq_assessment_vehicle_values UNIQUE (assessment_id);

ALTER TABLE pre_incident_estimates
  ADD CONSTRAINT uq_pre_incident_estimates UNIQUE (assessment_id);
```

**Files Changed:**
- `supabase/migrations/069_add_child_record_unique_constraints.sql` - NEW

**Data Cleanup:**
- Deleted 10 duplicate tyre records before applying constraints

**Impact:** Database enforces single record per assessment at constraint level

---

### Fix 5: Make Child Record createDefault Methods Truly Idempotent ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Comment said "idempotent" but wasn't
- Methods would throw constraint errors or create duplicates on retry
- 5 services affected:
  - TyresService
  - VehicleValuesService
  - PreIncidentEstimateService
  - DamageService
  - EstimateService

**Solution:**

**Pattern 1: UPSERT (for tyres with compound unique key)**
```typescript
// TyresService.createDefaultTyres
await db.from('assessment_tyres').upsert(
  { assessment_id, position, position_label },
  { onConflict: 'assessment_id,position', ignoreDuplicates: false }
)
```

**Pattern 2: Check-then-create (for single record per assessment)**
```typescript
// VehicleValuesService, PreIncidentEstimateService, DamageService, EstimateService
async createDefault(assessmentId: string, client?: ServiceClient) {
  const existing = await this.getByAssessment(assessmentId, client);
  if (existing) return existing; // ✅ Return existing if found
  return this.create({ assessment_id: assessmentId, ... }, client);
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/services/tyres.service.ts`
- `src/lib/services/vehicle-values.service.ts`
- `src/lib/services/pre-incident-estimate.service.ts`
- `src/lib/services/damage.service.ts`
- `src/lib/services/estimate.service.ts`

**Impact:**
- Page refreshes safe
- Retries safe
- Multiple calls safe
- **Truly idempotent**

---

### Fix 6: RequestService.createRequest Retry Logic ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- If request insert succeeds but assessment creation fails, retry loop creates duplicate request
- Retry scope included both request AND assessment creation
- Broke data integrity ("one assessment per request")

**Solution:**
```typescript
// OLD (WRONG - retries everything)
for (attempt...) {
  request = create request
  assessment = create assessment
  return { request, assessment }
}

// NEW (CORRECT - split retry scopes)
// Step 1: Create request (retry for duplicate number only)
for (attempt...) {
  request = create request
  if (success) break;
}

// Step 2: Create assessment (idempotent - no retry needed)
assessment = await findOrCreateByRequest(request.id, client);

return { request, assessment };
```

**File Changed:**
- `src/lib/services/request.service.ts`

**Impact:**
- Request creation retries only for duplicate number
- Assessment creation uses idempotent findOrCreate
- No duplicate requests created
- Maintains data integrity

---

## Verification Status

### Database Constraints ✅
```sql
-- All verified present
✅ assessment_damage: UNIQUE (assessment_id)
✅ assessment_estimates: UNIQUE (assessment_id)
✅ assessment_tyres: UNIQUE (assessment_id, position)
✅ assessment_vehicle_values: UNIQUE (assessment_id)
✅ pre_incident_estimates: UNIQUE (assessment_id)
```

### Service Methods ✅
```
✅ AssessmentService.updateAssessment - accepts client parameter
✅ AssessmentService.findOrCreateByRequest - correct maybeSingle handling
✅ TyresService.createDefaultTyres - upsert pattern
✅ VehicleValuesService.createDefault - check-then-create
✅ PreIncidentEstimateService.createDefault - check-then-create
✅ DamageService.createDefault - check-then-create
✅ EstimateService.createDefault - check-then-create
✅ RequestService.createRequest - split retry scopes
```

### Start Assessment Flow ✅
```
✅ Links appointment_id BEFORE updating stage
✅ Passes authenticated client throughout
✅ Uses array.includes() for stage checking
✅ Creates child records idempotently
```

**Implemented By:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)
**Code Review By:** User (comprehensive)
**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

### Fix 7: Engineer Assessment INSERT Policy ✅ FIXED (Corrected in Migration 071)

**Problem:**
- Engineer RLS INSERT policy required `appointment_id IS NOT NULL`
- Assessment-centric pattern creates assessments BEFORE appointments are scheduled
- Initial `appointment_id = null` for early stages (request_submitted, request_accepted)
- Engineers got RLS 42501 error when creating assessments

**First Attempt (Migration 070 - INCORRECT):**
- Required early stages to have `appointment_id IS NULL`
- **Logic error**: Code passes `appointment.id` when engineers open assessment page
- RLS CHECK still failed with 42501 error in production

**Corrected Solution (Migration 071):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Engineers can insert assessments for their appointments"
ON assessments FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  -- EARLY STAGES: Allow with OR without appointment_id
  (
    stage IN ('request_submitted', 'request_accepted')
    AND (
      -- Case 1: Admin creates assessment with request (no appointment yet)
      appointment_id IS NULL
      OR
      -- Case 2: Engineer opens assessment page with appointment context
      EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM appointments
        WHERE appointments.id = appointment_id
        AND appointments.engineer_id = get_user_engineer_id()
      )
    )
  )
  OR
  -- LATER STAGES: Require appointment with engineer assignment
  (
    stage NOT IN ('request_submitted', 'request_accepted')
    AND appointment_id IS NOT NULL
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM appointments
      WHERE appointments.id = appointment_id
      AND appointments.engineer_id = get_user_engineer_id()
    )
  )
);
```

**Files Changed:**
- `supabase/migrations/070_fix_assessment_centric_rls_policies.sql` - NEW (initial attempt)
- `supabase/migrations/071_fix_engineer_assessment_insert_logic.sql` - NEW (corrected logic)

**Impact:** Engineers can now create early-stage assessments with OR without appointments, covering both admin-created and engineer-opened scenarios

---

### Fix 8: Engineer Inspections SELECT Policy ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Engineer RLS SELECT policy checked `requests.assigned_engineer_id`
- New architecture assigns engineers to **appointments**, not requests
- Engineers got 406 Not Acceptable when querying inspections by request_id

**Solution:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Engineers can view assigned inspections"
ON inspections FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  -- NEW PATTERN: Check via appointments
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM appointments
    WHERE appointments.inspection_id = inspections.id
    AND appointments.engineer_id = get_user_engineer_id()
  )
  OR
  -- OLD PATTERN: Fallback for backward compatibility
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM requests
    WHERE requests.id = inspections.request_id
    AND requests.assigned_engineer_id = get_user_engineer_id()
  )
);
```

**File Changed:**
- `supabase/migrations/070_fix_assessment_centric_rls_policies.sql`

**Impact:** Dual-pattern approach supports both new (appointments) and old (requests) assignment methods

---

### Fix 9: Enforce Admin-Only Assessment Creation ✅ FIXED (Migration 072)

**Problem:**
- Engineers could still create assessments via `findOrCreateByRequest()`
- Violated assessment-centric architecture principle
- Architecture says: assessments created by admins when requests created
- Code allowed: engineers to create assessments if missing
- Migration 071 enabled engineer INSERT (fixed symptom, not root cause)

**Root Cause:**
- `findOrCreateByRequest()` would CREATE assessment if not found
- Engineers calling this method could trigger assessment creation
- RLS policy from Migration 071 allowed engineer INSERT for early stages
- 6 legacy requests existed without assessments

**Solution (4-Phase Fix):**

**Phase 1: Fix Legacy Data**
- Created assessments for 6 legacy requests (CLM-2025-012, 011, 010, 002, REQ-2025-001, CLM-2025-001)
- Used admin SQL script to bypass RLS
- Generated assessment numbers: ASM-2025-010 through ASM-2025-015
- Verified: 0 requests without assessments

**Phase 2: Update Service Layer**
```typescript
// NEW: findByRequest() - for engineer use (throws error if not found)
async findByRequest(requestId: string, client?: ServiceClient): Promise<Assessment> {
  const existing = await find...

  if (!existing) {
    throw new Error(
      'Data integrity error: No assessment found for request. ' +
      'Assessments must be created by admins when requests are created.'
    );
  }

  return existing;
}

// EXISTING: findOrCreateByRequest() - for admin use (creates if needed)
// Engineers cannot create due to RLS policy
```

**Phase 3: Remove Engineer INSERT Policy (Migration 072)**
```sql
-- Drop engineer INSERT policy from Migration 071
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Engineers can insert assessments for their appointments" ON assessments;

-- Result: Only admin INSERT policies remain
-- Engineers can SELECT and UPDATE, but NOT INSERT
```

**Phase 4: Update Assessment Page Server**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Used findOrCreateByRequest (could create as engineer)
let assessment = await assessmentService.findOrCreateByRequest(
  appointment.request_id,
  locals.supabase,
  appointment.id
);

// AFTER: Use findByRequest (throws error if not found)
try {
  assessment = await assessmentService.findByRequest(
    appointment.request_id,
    locals.supabase
  );
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Data integrity error: Assessment not found');
  throw error(500, 'Assessment not found. Please contact support.');
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `supabase/migrations/072_enforce_admin_only_assessment_creation.sql` - NEW
- `src/lib/services/assessment.service.ts` - Added findByRequest() method
- `src/routes/(app)/work/assessments/[appointment_id]/+page.server.ts` - Use findByRequest()

**Verification:**
```sql
-- RLS Policies on assessments:
DELETE: Only admins (1 policy)
INSERT: Only admins (2 policies)  ✅ No engineer policy
SELECT: Admins all, Engineers assigned (2 policies)
UPDATE: Admins all, Engineers assigned (2 policies)

-- All requests have assessments:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM requests r
LEFT JOIN assessments a ON a.request_id = r.id
WHERE a.id IS NULL;
-- Result: 0  ✅
```

**Impact:**
- Engineers CANNOT create assessments (RLS blocks INSERT)
- Architectural principle enforced: admins CREATE, engineers UPDATE
- Clear error messages for data integrity issues
- All legacy requests now have assessments
- No breaking changes (engineers never should have created assessments)

---
