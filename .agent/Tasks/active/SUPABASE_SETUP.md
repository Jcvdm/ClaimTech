# Supabase Setup Complete ✅

## What's Been Set Up

### 1. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Installed `@supabase/supabase-js`
- ✅ Created `.env` with Supabase credentials
- ✅ Created `.env.example` template
- ✅ Initialized Supabase client in `src/lib/supabase.ts`

### 2. Database Schema
- ✅ Created migration file: `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
- ✅ Created seed data file: `supabase/seed.sql`
- ✅ Tables created:
  - `clients` - Insurance and private clients
  - `requests` - Vehicle damage assessment requests
  - `request_tasks` - Tasks for each request
  - `engineers` - Loss adjusters/engineers
- ✅ Indexes for performance
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled with permissive dev policies
- ✅ Auto-updating `updated_at` triggers

### 3. TypeScript Types
- ✅ `src/lib/types/client.ts` - Client types and interfaces
- ✅ `src/lib/types/request.ts` - Request, Task types and interfaces
- ✅ `src/lib/types/engineer.ts` - Engineer types and interfaces
- ✅ `src/lib/types/database.ts` - Supabase database schema types

### 4. Service Layer (Data Access)
- ✅ `src/lib/services/client.service.ts` - Client CRUD operations
- ✅ `src/lib/services/request.service.ts` - Request CRUD operations
- ✅ `src/lib/services/task.service.ts` - Task CRUD operations
- ✅ `src/lib/services/engineer.service.ts` - Engineer CRUD operations

All services include:
- List/Get operations with filtering
- Create/Update/Delete operations
- Search functionality
- Error handling
- TypeScript type safety

## Next Steps

### 1. Run Database Migrations

Go to your Supabase dashboard and run the migrations:

1. Visit: https://cfblmkzleqtvtfxujikf.supabase.co
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy and paste `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
5. Click **Run**
6. (Optional) Run `supabase/seed.sql` for sample data

### 2. Build the UI

Now we can build the frontend pages:

- [ ] Update Sidebar navigation with Clients and Requests sections
- [ ] Create Client management pages (`/clients`, `/clients/new`, `/clients/[id]`)
- [ ] Create Request management pages (`/requests`, `/requests/new`, `/requests/[id]`)
- [ ] Build form components (ClientForm, RequestForm sections)
- [ ] Build ClientQuickAdd modal for creating clients from request form

### 3. Test the Flow

Once UI is built, test the complete flow:
1. Create a new client
2. Create a new request for that client
3. Assign an engineer
4. Create tasks for the request
5. Update request status through workflow steps

## Database Schema Overview

### Workflow Steps
1. **Request** - Initial request created
2. **Assessment** - Engineer assesses damage
3. **Quote** - Quote/estimate prepared
4. **Approval** - Final approval

### Request Statuses
- `draft` - Being created
- `submitted` - Submitted for processing
- `in_progress` - Being worked on
- `completed` - Finished
- `cancelled` - Cancelled

### Sample Data Included
- 5 clients (3 insurance, 2 private)
- 3 engineers
- 3 requests at different stages
- 4 tasks

## Service Usage Examples

### Creating a Client
```typescript
import { clientService } from '$lib/services/client.service';

const newClient = await clientService.createClient({
  name: 'Santam Insurance',
  type: 'insurance',
  contact_name: 'John Smith',
  email: 'john@santam.co.za',
  phone: '+27 11 123 4567'
});
```

### Creating a Request
```typescript
import { requestService } from '$lib/services/request.service';

const newRequest = await requestService.createRequest({
  client_id: 'client-uuid',
  type: 'insurance',
  claim_number: 'SANT-2025-12345',
  description: 'Front-end collision',
  vehicle_make: 'BMW',
  vehicle_model: '320i',
  vehicle_year: 2022,
  owner_name: 'John Doe',
  owner_phone: '+27 82 123 4567'
});
```

### Listing Requests with Filters
```typescript
// Get all submitted requests
const submittedRequests = await requestService.listRequests({ 
  status: 'submitted' 
});

// Get requests for a specific client
const clientRequests = await requestService.listRequests({ 
  client_id: 'client-uuid' 
});

// Get requests assigned to an engineer
const engineerRequests = await requestService.listRequests({ 
  assigned_engineer_id: 'engineer-uuid' 
});
```

## Type Safety

All services are fully typed with TypeScript:
- Input validation with typed interfaces
- Return types for all operations
- Null safety for optional fields
- Enum types for statuses and steps

## Error Handling

All services include error handling:
- Console logging for debugging
- Descriptive error messages
- Null returns for not-found cases
- Exception throwing for failures

**Status**: ✅ Backend setup complete, ready for UI development!
