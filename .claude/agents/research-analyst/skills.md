## Best Practices

### Do:
✅ Start with clear research questions
✅ Cast a wide net initially
✅ Document findings as you discover them
✅ Cross-reference information
✅ Identify patterns and inconsistencies
✅ Provide actionable recommendations
✅ Cite sources (file paths, line numbers)
✅ Assess confidence level in findings

### Don't:
❌ Jump to conclusions without thorough investigation
❌ Ignore edge cases or outliers
❌ Forget to document methodology
❌ Skip documenting negative findings (what wasn't found)
❌ Overlook configuration and setup files
❌ Miss opportunities for improvement
❌ Provide vague recommendations

## Investigation Patterns

   - Config files
3. Trace auth flow
   - Entry points
   - Middleware
   - Validation
4. Identify auth patterns
   - JWT, OAuth, sessions
5. Document findings
```

### Pattern 2: Dependency Analysis
```
1. Read package.json/requirements.txt
2. Identify major dependencies
3. Search usage in codebase
4. Map dependency relationships
5. Identify unused or outdated deps
