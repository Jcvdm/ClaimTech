## Code Review Coordination

### Single-Agent Review
```
For simple PRs:
1. Launch code-quality-analyzer
2. Review specific changes
3. Generate quality report
4. Post findings as PR comment
```

### Multi-Agent Review (Swarm)
```
For complex PRs:
1. Analyze PR scope
2. Identify review dimensions:
   - Code quality
   - Security
   - Performance
   - Architecture
   - Testing

3. Launch specialized agents in parallel:
   - code-quality-analyzer: Overall quality
   - backend-api-dev: API and database changes
   - system-architect: Architecture review

4. Aggregate findings
5. Prioritize issues
6. Post comprehensive review
```

### Review Report Template
```markdown
# Code Review Report

**PR:** #123 - Add user authentication
**Reviewers:** code-quality-analyzer, backend-api-dev
**Date:** 2024-01-15

## Summary
Overall good implementation with minor improvements needed.

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ Approve with suggestions

## Quality Assessment

| Dimension | Score | Reviewer |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Code Quality | 8/10 | code-quality-analyzer |
| Security | 9/10 | backend-api-dev |
| Performance | 8/10 | backend-api-dev |
| Testing | 7/10 | code-quality-analyzer |

## Critical Issues
None

## High Priority
1. **Add rate limiting to auth endpoints**
   - File: `app/api/auth/route.ts`
   - Reviewer: backend-api-dev
   - Recommendation: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force

## Medium Priority
1. **Increase test coverage**
   - Reviewer: code-quality-analyzer
   - Current: 75%, Target: 85%
   - Missing: Error case tests

## Suggestions
1. Consider caching user sessions
2. Add logging for failed auth attempts
3. Document OAuth setup process

## Positive Observations
- ‚úÖ Clean code structure

- [x] Documentation updated
- [ ] Rate limiting needed

## Next Steps
1. Add rate limiting
2. Increase test coverage to 85%
3. Address medium priority items
4. Re-review if needed

## CI/CD Integration

### Checking PR Status
```bash
# View PR checks status
gh pr checks

# View specific check details
gh pr checks --watch

# View PR status
gh pr status
```

### Handling Failed Checks
```typescript
// Pseudo-code for check handling
async function handleFailedChecks(prNumber: number) {
  const checks = await getChecks(prNumber);

  for (const check of checks) {
    if (check.status === 'failed') {
      // Analyze failure
      const logs = await getCheckLogs(check.id);

      // Categorize failure
      if (logs.includes('test failed')) {
        // Test failure - needs code fix
        await addComment(prNumber,
          `Test failure detected: ${check.name}\nPlease review and fix failing tests.`
        );
      } else if (logs.includes('build failed')) {
        // Build failure - compilation error
        await addComment(prNumber,
          `Build failure in ${check.name}\nPlease fix compilation errors.`
        );
      } else if (logs.includes('lint')) {
        // Linting failure - code style
        await addComment(prNumber,
          `Linting errors detected. Run \`npm run lint:fix\` to auto-fix.`
        );
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Merge Strategies

### Strategy Selection
```
Choose merge strategy based on:

1. Squash and Merge
   - When: Multiple small commits, clean history desired
   - Result: Single commit in main branch
   - Use: Feature branches

2. Merge Commit
   - When: Want to preserve commit history
   - Result: All commits + merge commit
   - Use: Important features, releases

3. Rebase and Merge
   - When: Linear history desired
   - Result: All commits replayed on main
   - Use: Clean, logical commit history
```

### Merge Execution
```bash
# Squash merge (most common for features)
gh pr merge 123 --squash --delete-branch

# Regular merge (preserve history)
gh pr merge 123 --merge --delete-branch

# Rebase merge (linear history)
gh pr merge 123 --rebase --delete-branch

# Auto-merge when checks pass
gh pr merge 123 --auto --squash
```

### Merge Checklist
```
Before merging:
- [ ] All checks passed
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Branch up to date with base
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Breaking changes communicated
- [ ] Migration guide provided (if needed)
```

## Conflict Resolution

### Detection
```bash
# Check for conflicts
git fetch origin main
git merge-base HEAD origin/main
git diff origin/main...HEAD

# View files with conflicts
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
```

### Coordination
```
When conflicts detected:
1. Notify PR author
2. Provide conflict summary
3. Suggest resolution strategy:
   - Rebase on main
   - Merge main into branch
   - Resolve specific conflicts

4. Validate resolution
5. Re-run checks
```

## Best Practices

### Do:
‚úÖ Write clear, descriptive PR titles
‚úÖ Provide comprehensive PR descriptions
‚úÖ Include test plan in PR
‚úÖ Link related issues
‚úÖ Keep PRs focused and small when possible
‚úÖ Ensure all checks pass before requesting review
‚úÖ Respond to review comments promptly
‚úÖ Update PR description if scope changes
‚úÖ Use draft PRs for work in progress
‚úÖ Delete branch after merge

### Don't:
‚ùå Create massive PRs (>500 lines if avoidable)
‚ùå Mix unrelated changes
‚ùå Merge with failing tests
‚ùå Skip PR description
‚ùå Force push after review started
‚ùå Merge without review (unless trivial)
‚ùå Ignore CI failures
‚ùå Leave branches after merge
‚ùå Create PRs with merge conflicts
‚ùå Forget to update documentation
