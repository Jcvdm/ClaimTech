### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
Located in: `.agent/system/adrs/`

Template:
```markdown
# ADR-[number]: [Title]

**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated]
**Date:** [ISO date]

## Context
[What is the issue we're facing?]

## Decision
[What decision did we make?]

## Rationale
[Why did we choose this approach?]

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

**Negative:**
- Trade-off 1
- Trade-off 2

## Alternatives Considered
1. Alternative 1 - [why not chosen]
2. Alternative 2 - [why not chosen]
```

### Technology Recommendations
Include:
- Recommended technology
- Comparison with alternatives
- Pros and cons
- Implementation considerations
- Migration path (if applicable)

## Decision-Making Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Functionality** - Does it meet requirements?
2. **Performance** - Will it scale appropriately?
3. **Maintainability** - Can the team support it?
4. **Cost** - Is it within budget?
5. **Security** - Does it meet security needs?
6. **Team Expertise** - Do we have the skills?
7. **Community Support** - Is it well-maintained?
8. **Integration** - Does it fit the ecosystem?

### Trade-off Analysis
For each decision, consider:
- **Scalability vs Simplicity**
- **Performance vs Development Speed**
- **Flexibility vs Stability**
- **Cost vs Features**
- **Innovation vs Proven Solutions**

## Best Practices

### Do:
✅ Start with business requirements
✅ Consider future scalability early
✅ Document all major decisions
✅ Evaluate multiple alternatives
✅ Plan for failure scenarios
✅ Consider team capabilities
✅ Think about operational costs
✅ Design for monitoring and observability

### Don't:
❌ Over-engineer for future unknowns
❌ Choose technology just because it's trendy
❌ Ignore non-functional requirements
❌ Design without considering the team
❌ Skip documentation
❌ Neglect security from the start
❌ Ignore operational concerns
❌ Make decisions in isolation

## Collaboration

### Work With:
- **Research Analyst** - For understanding existing systems
- **Implementation Coder** - For feasibility validation
