## Critical Issues 🔴
[Issues requiring immediate attention]

### Issue 1: SQL Injection Vulnerability
**File:** `src/services/userService.ts:45`
**Severity:** Critical
**Description:** Raw SQL query with unsanitized user input
```typescript
// Current (UNSAFE)
db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`);

// Recommended
db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1', [email]);
```

## High Priority Issues 🟡
[Important issues to address soon]

### Issue 1: High Complexity Function
**File:** `src/utils/validator.ts:120`
**Severity:** High
**Cyclomatic Complexity:** 15 (threshold: 10)
**Recommendation:** Break down into smaller functions

## Medium Priority Issues 🔵
[Issues to address when time allows]

## Code Smells
- Long Method: `processOrder()` (150 lines)
- Large Class: `UserService` (8 responsibilities)
- Duplicate Code: Validation logic repeated 5 times
- Feature Envy: `Order` accessing too many `User` properties

## Positive Observations ✅
- Excellent error handling in payment module
- Consistent use of TypeScript types
- Good separation of concerns in API layer
- Well-structured test suite

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix SQL injection vulnerability in userService
2. Add input validation to payment endpoints
3. Update vulnerable dependency: `lodash` to latest

### Short-term Improvements
1. Refactor complex functions (>10 complexity)
2. Extract duplicate validation logic
3. Add missing error handling in upload service
4. Increase test coverage to >80%

### Long-term Enhancements
1. Consider implementing caching layer
2. Refactor UserService (too many responsibilities)
3. Migrate to more maintainable state management
4. Implement comprehensive logging strategy

## Detailed Analysis

### File: src/services/userService.ts
**Grade: C+**

**Strengths:**
- Clear function names
- Good TypeScript usage

**Issues:**
- Lines 45-47: SQL injection risk
- Lines 89-120: Function too complex (complexity: 12)
- Line 150: Error swallowing (empty catch block)

**Recommendations:**
1. Use parameterized queries
2. Break down `updateUserProfile` function
3. Properly handle errors, don't swallow them

### File: src/components/UserDashboard.tsx
**Grade: B+**

**Strengths:**
- Clean component structure
- Proper hooks usage
- Good prop typing

**Issues:**
- Missing loading and error states
- Inline styles should be extracted
- useEffect missing dependency

**Recommendations:**
1. Add loading spinner and error boundaries
2. Move styles to CSS module or styled-components
3. Add `userId` to useEffect dependencies

## Testing Assessment

**Current Coverage:** 72%
**Target Coverage:** 85%

**Missing Tests:**
- Error handling paths
- Edge cases in validation
- Integration tests for API endpoints

**Test Quality:**
- ✅ Good: Unit tests are well-structured
- ❌ Bad: Many tests are testing implementation, not behavior
- ⚠️ Concern: Mocks are too broad, may hide issues

## Performance Analysis

**Identified Issues:**
1. **N+1 Query Problem** in `getUsersWithOrders()`
   - File: `src/services/orderService.ts:45`
   - Impact: High
   - Solution: Use JOIN or eager loading

2. **Large Bundle Size**
   - lodash imported in full: +70KB
   - Solution: Use lodash-es and import only needed functions

3. **Missing Caching**
   - Static data fetched on every request
   - Solution: Implement Redis caching

## Security Findings

**Critical:**
- SQL Injection in userService.ts:45
- Missing authentication check on admin endpoint

**High:**
- No rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Passwords not using bcrypt (using plain hash)

**Medium:**
- Missing CSRF protection
- Overly permissive CORS settings

**Recommendations:**
1. Immediate: Fix SQL injection
2. Immediate: Add authentication to admin routes
3. Short-term: Implement rate limiting
4. Short-term: Migrate to bcrypt for passwords

## Dependency Analysis

**Vulnerable:**
- `lodash@4.17.15` - Update to 4.17.21
- `axios@0.21.0` - Update to 1.6.0

**Outdated:**
- `react@17.0.2` - Consider upgrading to 18
- `next@12.0.0` - Consider upgrading to 14

**Unused:**
- `moment` - Not used, remove
- `jquery` - Not used, remove (-30KB)
