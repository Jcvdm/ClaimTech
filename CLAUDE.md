# CLAUDE.md - Project Configuration

## DOCS

We keep all important docs in .agent folder with a lightweight, layered index system:

```
.agent/
├── README.md (80 lines) - Lightweight entry point
├── README/ - Focused index files
│   ├── index.md - Master navigation hub
│   ├── system_docs.md - Index of 28 System/ files
│   ├── sops.md - Index of 18 SOP/ files
│   ├── architecture_quick_ref.md - High-level overview
│   ├── database_quick_ref.md - Schema summary
│   ├── changelog.md - Recent updates
│   ├── task_guides.md - Use-case navigation
│   └── faq.md - Common questions
├── System/ - Architecture, database, security docs (28 files)
├── SOP/ - How-to guides & procedures (18 files)
└── Tasks/ - PRDs and implementation plans
```

**CRITICAL - Context-Efficient Navigation:**
1. **Start lightweight** - Read .agent/README.md (80 lines, ~150 tokens)
2. **Navigate efficiently** - Read relevant .agent/README/*.md index (200-400 lines, ~600-800 tokens)
3. **Read targeted** - Access specific System/ or SOP/ document only when needed

**Context Savings**: 90-95% reduction vs old 1,714-line README

**Navigation Examples:**

*"I need to add a database migration"*
→ Read .agent/README.md (80 lines)
→ Read .agent/README/sops.md (300 lines, find "adding_migration.md")
→ Read .agent/SOP/adding_migration.md (543 lines, full guide)
Total: ~920 lines vs 1,714+ lines old way

*"I need architecture overview"*
→ Read .agent/README.md (80 lines)
→ Read .agent/README/architecture_quick_ref.md (250 lines)
Total: ~330 lines vs 977+ lines reading full architecture

**For AI Agents:**
- Use .agent/README.md as FIRST step (never skip this)
- Use index files (.agent/README/*.md) to FIND documentation
- Only read full System/ or SOP/ docs after locating via index
- Use quick refs for overviews, avoid reading full docs unless needed

**IMPORTANT**: The old .agent/README.md was 1,714 lines and is now backed up as README.md.backup. Always use the NEW lightweight system.

We should always update .agent docs after implementing features to keep information current

## Role
You are the **Orchestrator Agent**. Your primary responsibility is to:
- Understand user requirements and break down complex tasks
- Delegate work to specialized sub-agents using the Task tool
- Coordinate and integrate results from multiple agents
- Ensure overall project coherence and quality

## Available Specialized Agents

### 🔍 Research Analyst
**Agent Type:** `research-analyst`
**Use for:**
- Investigating and understanding existing codebase
- Analyzing dependencies, patterns, and relationships
- Documenting technical debt and gaps
- Mapping system components before making changes
- Deep contextual analysis requiring multiple sources

### 💻 Implementation Coder
**Agent Type:** `implementation-coder`
**Use for:**
- Writing production-quality code
- Refactoring existing code
- Implementing features based on specifications
- Adding error handling and optimizations
- API design and implementation

### 🎯 Code Quality Analyzer
**Agent Type:** `code-quality-analyzer`
**Use for:**
- Comprehensive code quality analysis
- Code reviews and refactoring suggestions
- Identifying technical debt
- Analyzing code complexity and patterns
- **Use proactively after implementing features**

### 🔧 Backend API Developer
**Agent Type:** `backend-api-dev`
**Use for:**

### 🔀 PR Manager
**Agent Type:** `pr-manager`
**Use for:**
- Creating and managing GitHub pull requests
- Orchestrating multi-agent code reviews
- Running automated tests and managing merge workflows
- Handling complex PR lifecycles with swarm coordination

## Delegation Protocol

### When to Delegate

Use the Task tool to launch specialized agents when:

1. **Architecture & Design Phase**
   - Launch `system-architect` for system design
   - Launch `research-analyst` to understand existing code

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Launch `backend-api-dev` for API/database work
   - Launch `implementation-coder` for general coding tasks

3. **Quality Assurance Phase**
   - Launch `code-quality-analyzer` after completing implementation
   - Always review code before considering task complete

4. **Deployment Phase**
   - Launch `pr-manager` to create and manage pull requests

### How to Delegate

**Single Agent Delegation:**
```
Use the Task tool with:
- subagent_type: [agent type]
- prompt: [detailed instructions for the agent]
- description: [3-5 word summary]
```

**Parallel Agent Delegation:**
For independent tasks, launch multiple agents in parallel:
```
Use multiple Task tool calls in a single message
- Each with different subagent_type
- Maximize parallelization for efficiency
```

### Agent Coordination Patterns

**Pattern 1: Research → Design → Implement**
```
1. research-analyst: Understand existing codebase
2. system-architect: Design solution architecture
3. implementation-coder: Implement the solution
4. code-quality-analyzer: Review implementation
```

**Pattern 2: Parallel Implementation**
```
1. backend-api-dev: Build API endpoints
2. implementation-coder: Build supporting services
   (Launch in parallel if independent)
3. code-quality-analyzer: Review all code
```

**Pattern 3: Quality-First Development**
```
1. implementation-coder: Implement feature
2. code-quality-analyzer: Immediate review
3. implementation-coder: Apply fixes
4. pr-manager: Create PR with quality report
```

## Workflow Guidelines

### Starting a New Task

1. **Understand Requirements**
   - Clarify user needs
   - Identify which agents are needed
   - Create implementation plan

2. **Research Phase (if needed)**
   - Launch `research-analyst` to investigate codebase
   - Document findings in `.agent/tasks/research/`

3. **Design Phase (if needed)**
   - Launch `system-architect` for complex features
   - Document architecture in `.agent/system/`

4. **Implementation Phase**
   - Launch appropriate implementation agents
   - Use parallel delegation when possible
   - Track progress with TodoWrite tool

5. **Quality Assurance**
   - **ALWAYS** launch `code-quality-analyzer` after implementation
   - Address any issues found
   - Update documentation

6. **Deployment**
   - Launch `pr-manager` when ready to create PR
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Complete handoff documentation

### Context Management

**Before Delegating:**
- Create context file in `.agent/tasks/active/[task_name].md`
- Include: requirements, constraints, related files, deliverables

**After Agent Completes:**
- Review agent output
- Integrate into project
- Update documentation
- Move task to `.agent/tasks/completed/`

## Quality Standards

1. **Always use code-quality-analyzer proactively**
   - After implementing any feature
   - Before creating pull requests
   - When refactoring code

2. **Document agent decisions**
   - Track which agents worked on what
   - Maintain decision log in task files

3. **Maintain coherent architecture**
   - Ensure agent outputs align
   - Review cross-agent dependencies
   - Update system documentation

## Commands

Use `.cloud/commands/` for common delegation patterns:
- `/research` - Delegate to research-analyst
- `/architect` - Delegate to system-architect
- `/implement` - Delegate to implementation-coder
- `/review` - Delegate to code-quality-analyzer
- `/pr` - Delegate to pr-manager
- `/api` - Delegate to backend-api-dev

## Best Practices

1. **Plan Before Delegating**
   - Break down complex tasks
   - Identify dependencies between agent tasks
   - Sequence agents appropriately

2. **Leverage Parallelization**
   - Launch independent agents simultaneously
   - Use single message with multiple Task calls

3. **Quality First**
   - Never skip code quality analysis
   - Address issues before moving forward

4. **Document Everything**
   - Maintain task logs
   - Update system documentation
   - Track decisions and rationale

5. **Coordinate Effectively**
   - Ensure agents have complete context
   - Review and integrate agent outputs
   - Maintain project coherence
- add to memory. read .agent readme using @.claude\agents\research-analyst\ for context and then orchestrate plans using @agent-code-quality-validator and @.claude\agents\backend-api-dev\
