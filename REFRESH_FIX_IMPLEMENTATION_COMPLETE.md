# Random Refresh Fix - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: The app was randomly refreshing during editing, causing data loss for unsaved user input.

**Root Cause**: Broad use of `invalidateAll()` throughout the application was triggering full route data refetches and component re-renders, wiping out local form state.

**Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive fix across all phases:
1. Removed all `invalidateAll()` calls from assessment detail page
2. Created reusable draft and unsaved changes utilities
3. Applied unsaved changes guards to edit pages
4. Refined post-mutation invalidations to use navigation instead
5. Optimized sidebar polling to pause on edit routes

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### Phase 1: Assessment Detail Page Fixed ✅

**File**: `src/routes/(app)/work/assessments/[appointment_id]/+page.svelte`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Removed `invalidateAll()` from auto-save function (was causing 30s refresh)
- ✅ Removed `invalidateAll()` from 40+ handler functions across all tabs
- ✅ Removed unused `invalidateAll` import
- ✅ Added explanatory comments for future maintainers

**Result**: Assessment detail page no longer refreshes during editing. Form input is preserved across auto-saves.

---

### Phase 2: Reusable Utilities Created ✅

#### 1. Draft Autosave Utility
**File**: `src/lib/utils/useDraft.svelte.ts`

**Features**:
- localStorage-based draft persistence
- Throttled writes (default: 2s)
- Automatic restore on mount
- Timestamp tracking
- Two APIs: `useDraft()` (functional) and `useDraftState()` (reactive with Svelte 5 runes)

**Usage**:
```typescript
// Functional API
const draft = useDraft<MyFormData>('my-form-key');
draft.save(formData);
const restored = draft.get();

// Reactive API (auto-saves on state change)
const { value, clearDraft, hasDraft } = useDraftState('my-form-key', initialValue);
```

#### 2. Unsaved Changes Guard
**File**: `src/lib/utils/useUnsavedChanges.svelte.ts`

**Features**:
- `beforeunload` warning for page refresh/close
- SvelteKit navigation confirmation dialog
- Reactive tracker API
- Debounce and throttle utilities

**Usage**:
```typescript
// Simple guard
useUnsavedChanges(() => hasUnsavedChanges, {
  message: 'You have unsaved changes. Are you sure you want to leave?'
});

// Reactive tracker
const { hasUnsavedChanges, markUnsaved, markSaved } = useUnsavedChangesTracker();
```

---

### Phase 3: Edit Pages Protected ✅

#### Requests Edit Page
**File**: `src/routes/(app)/requests/[id]/edit/+page.svelte`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added `useUnsavedChanges` guard
- ✅ Tracks all form field changes using `$effect`
- ✅ Clears flag before navigation after successful save
- ✅ Warns user on page refresh, close, or navigation with unsaved changes

**Implementation**:
```typescript
let hasUnsavedChanges = $state(false);

useUnsavedChanges(() => hasUnsavedChanges, {
  message: 'You have unsaved changes to this request. Are you sure you want to leave?'
});

$effect(() => {
  // Track all form fields - if any change from initial values, mark as unsaved
  const hasChanges = /* compare all fields */;
  hasUnsavedChanges = hasChanges;
});

async function handleSubmit() {
  await requestService.updateRequest(data.request.id, requestData);
  hasUnsavedChanges = false; // Clear before navigation
  goto(`/requests/${data.request.id}`);
}
```

#### Inspections & Appointments Detail Pages
**Status**: Cancelled - these pages don't have editable forms, only action buttons.

---

### Phase 4: Post-Mutation Invalidations Refined ✅

Replaced all `invalidateAll()` calls after mutations with targeted navigation:

#### Inspections Detail Page
**File**: `src/routes/(app)/work/inspections/[id]/+page.svelte`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Cancel inspection → Navigate to `/work/inspections`
- ✅ Reactivate inspection → Navigate to `/work/inspections`
- ✅ Create appointment → Navigate to `/work/appointments`
- ✅ Appoint engineer → Refresh current page with `goto()`
- ✅ Removed unused `invalidateAll` import

#### Requests Detail Page
**File**: `src/routes/(app)/requests/[id]/+page.svelte`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Cancel request → Navigate to `/requests`
- ✅ Reactivate request → Refresh current page with `goto()`
- ✅ Accept request (create inspection) → Navigate to `/work/inspections/[id]`
- ✅ Removed unused `invalidateAll` import

#### Appointments Detail Page
**File**: `src/routes/(app)/work/appointments/[id]/+page.svelte`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Complete appointment → Refresh current page with `goto()`
- ✅ Cancel appointment → Navigate to `/work/appointments`
- ✅ Removed unused `invalidateAll` import

**Pattern**: After mutations, either:
1. Navigate to a list page (data will be fresh on next page load)
2. Navigate to the same page to trigger a fresh data load
3. Navigate to a related detail page

**Result**: No more broad `invalidateAll()` calls that refresh unrelated data.

---

### Phase 5: Sidebar Polling Optimized ✅

**File**: `src/lib/components/layout/Sidebar.svelte`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added `isEditRoute()` helper to detect edit/heavy-input pages
- ✅ Pause polling on edit routes (includes `/edit`, `/new`, `/assessments/`)
- ✅ Resume polling when navigating away from edit routes
- ✅ Maintain existing behavior: refresh counts when navigating to work pages

**Implementation**:
```typescript
function isEditRoute(pathname: string): boolean {
  return (
    pathname.includes('/edit') ||
    pathname.includes('/new') ||
    pathname.includes('/assessments/') // Assessment detail page with heavy editing
  );
}

$effect(() => {
  if (browser) {
    const url = $page.url.pathname;
    
    // Pause polling on edit routes
    if (isEditRoute(url)) {
      if (pollingInterval) {
        clearInterval(pollingInterval);
        pollingInterval = null;
      }
    } else {
      // Resume polling if not already running
      if (!pollingInterval) {
        pollingInterval = setInterval(loadAllCounts, 30000);
      }
      
      // Refresh counts when navigating to work-related pages
      if (url.includes('/work/')) {
        loadAllCounts();
      }
    }
  }
});
```

**Result**: Sidebar polling pauses during editing, reducing network noise and potential interference.

## 🎯 Best Practices Applied

### 1. Avoid `invalidateAll()` During Editing
- ❌ **Before**: Auto-save called `invalidateAll()` every 30s
- ✅ **After**: Auto-save only updates service-level state

### 2. Progressive Enhancement
- Use `enhance` or superforms to submit updates without navigation
- Rely on service-level state updates without page reloads

### 3. Preserve Local State
- Draft autosave to localStorage while typing
- Throttled writes to backend (default: 2s)
- Automatic restore on mount

### 4. Unsaved Changes Guard
- `beforeunload` warning for page refresh/close
- SvelteKit navigation confirmation
- Reactive tracker API

### 5. Targeted Invalidation
- Use navigation to trigger fresh data loads
- Avoid broad `invalidateAll()` after mutations
- Navigate to list pages or refresh current page

### 6. Polling Optimization
- Pause background polling on edit routes
- Resume polling when navigating away
- Reduce network noise during editing
